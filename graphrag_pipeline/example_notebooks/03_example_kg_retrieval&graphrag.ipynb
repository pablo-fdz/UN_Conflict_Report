      "**I. Introduction**\n",
      "Sudan has remained engulfed in a devastating civil conflict over the past year, primarily between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). While fighting has ravaged Khartoum and other regions, the conflict's expansion to previously relatively secure areas, particularly Port Sudan, marks a significant escalation and poses new challenges to the country's stability and humanitarian efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Key Security Events (Last Year): Expansion of Conflict to Port Sudan**\n",
      "\n",
      "The most critical development in Sudan's security landscape over the last year has been the extension of direct conflict to **Port Sudan**, the country's vital Red Sea port and a key logistical hub for the SAF and humanitarian aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Initial Drone Attacks on Civilian and Military Facilities:** In a notable shift, the Sudanese military reported drone attacks on Port Sudan, specifically targeting civilian facilities, including an air base and a cargo warehouse. These strikes were accompanied by unverified reports of power outages in parts of the city (Sudanese military, citing official; unverified reports).\n",
      "*   **Subsequent and Unspecified Drone Strikes:** Following these initial reports, Sudanese media continued to report new drone attacks on unspecified areas within Port Sudan, indicating ongoing aerial threats. Air defense systems were reportedly active in response to these incursions (Sudanese media).\n",
      "*   **Major Incident: Oil Depot Fires Linked to RSF Strikes:** A significant escalation occurred with reports and social media images of large fires burning at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan. This incident was strongly linked to RSF paramilitary drone strikes, marking the *first* such RSF attack in Port Sudan since the civil war began. This event underscored the RSF's expanding operational reach and willingness to target critical economic infrastructure (Editor's note, social media images).\n",
      "\n",
      "These events collectively signify a critical turning point, as Port Sudan, previously a relatively safe haven and the de facto administrative capital for the SAF, became a direct target. This expansion of the conflict demonstrates the RSF's evolving capabilities and strategic intent to disrupt the SAF's supply lines and economic lifelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Forward-Looking Perspective**\n",
      "\n",
      "The targeting of Port Sudan has profound implications for Sudan's future:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Escalation and Destabilization:** The ability of the RSF to strike Port Sudan indicates a deepening and broadening of the conflict. This threatens the last major operational port and supply route for the SAF, potentially crippling their logistical capabilities and further destabilizing the entire country.\n",
      "*   **Exacerbated Humanitarian Crisis:** Attacks on critical infrastructure, especially a port vital for aid delivery, will severely exacerbate Sudan's already dire humanitarian crisis, hindering the flow of essential goods and assistance to millions in need.\n",
      "*   **Economic Ruin:** Disruption to Port Sudan's operations will have catastrophic consequences for Sudan's economy, impacting trade, imports of essential goods, and the country's ability to generate revenue.\n",
      "*   **Protracted Conflict:** The expansion of the conflict to Port Sudan suggests a protracted and increasingly destructive war. The RSF's demonstrated capability to project power to this strategic location indicates a willingness to escalate tactics, making a swift resolution unlikely. The immediate future points towards continued intense fighting, with a high risk of further infrastructure damage and civilian casualties across a wider geographical area.\n",

      "Sudan has endured a year of escalating civil war, primarily between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict has intensified, marked by a significant expansion of drone warfare, targeting critical infrastructure and civilian areas. This has precipitated a severe humanitarian crisis, widespread displacement, and a near-total collapse of essential services. The forward-looking perspective indicates a grim trajectory, with continued conflict, deepening humanitarian needs, and a high risk of regional destabilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Key Security Events (Last Year)**\n",
      "\n",
      "The past year in Sudan has been defined by the brutal conflict between the SAF and the RSF, with a series of impactful events shaping the security landscape:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Escalation of Drone Warfare and Attacks on Critical Infrastructure:**\n",
      "    *   **Port Sudan Under Fire:** The RSF demonstrated an expanded operational reach by launching unprecedented drone attacks on Port Sudan, a vital government-controlled area and the country's main port. These strikes targeted civilian facilities, including the Osman Digna Air Base, a cargo warehouse, oil depots, and power stations. Reports from Sudanese military and media indicated large fires at multiple oil depots and power outages in parts of the city, leading to suspended flights at Port Sudan International Airport. (Sources: Sudanese military, Sudanese media, Editor's note - Owen, RSF paramilitary, military source, local media, eyewitnesses).\n",
      "    *   **Attacks Beyond the Capital:** Drone attacks by the RSF were also reported in other strategic locations. The Atbara airport, a government-controlled facility, was targeted, with some drones reportedly shot down by anti-aircraft networks. Military bases, fuel depots, and pump stations in areas like Kosti and Merowe also faced drone strikes. (Sources: RSF, military source, local media, anti-aircraft networks).\n",
      "    *   **Impact on Energy and Logistics:** The repeated targeting of oil depots, fuel depots, and power stations across Port Sudan, Kosti, and Omdurman by RSF forces caused significant damage to energy infrastructure, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis and disrupting essential services. (Sources: RSF, Sudanese electric utility company, Sudanese civil defense).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Intensified Ground Clashes and Urban Warfare:**\n",
      "    *   **Khartoum and Omdurman Battlegrounds:** Intense fighting continued in Khartoum State, particularly Omdurman, where the RSF and SAF engaged in heavy clashes. The RSF was responsible for the bombing of three power stations in Omdurman. The SAF, in turn, conducted large-scale operations to regain control of areas, including the recapture of Khartoum State. (Sources: RSF, army, Sudanese armed forces).\n",
      "    *   **Control of Key Towns:** The RSF captured En Nahud in West Kordofan, leading to reports of looting, attacks on public buildings, and the killing of civilians. A prison in El Obeid was struck by RSF forces, and there were reports of inmate releases. (Sources: RSF, Sudan Doctors Union).\n",
      "    *   **Darfur Conflict:** Fighting for control of North Darfur persisted, with reports of military shelling in Nyala and attacks on areas like Abu Shouk Camp. (Sources: RSF, Sudanese armed forces, local media).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Devastating Humanitarian Impact:**\n",
      "    *   **Civilian Casualties and Displacement:** The conflict resulted in widespread civilian casualties, with the RSF accused of attacking and killing civilians in various locations, including En Nahud. The scale of internal displacement and refugee flows into neighboring countries has been immense.\n",
      "    *   **Attacks on Healthcare and Aid:** Hospitals, such as El Obeid Hospital and MSF's hospital in Old Fangak, were subjected to shelling and airstrikes, severely impacting healthcare access. Aid convoys, including those from UNICEF and WFP, were attacked in El Obeid and Al Koma, hindering critical humanitarian relief efforts. (Sources: RSF, officials, Sudan Doctors Union, MSF, UNICEF, WFP).\n",
      "    *   **Cholera Outbreak:** A significant cholera outbreak was reported, with the health ministry confirming 727 cases and 12 deaths, primarily in Khartoum and Northern State, further straining an already collapsed health system. (Sources: health ministry, officials).\n",
      "    *   **Mass Graves:** The discovery of 465 bodies in mass graves in the Shagra area (Omdurman) highlighted the brutal nature of the conflict and potential atrocities committed against civilians. (Source: Sudanese armed forces).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **External Dimensions:**\n",
      "    *   The US imposed sanctions on Sudan, reflecting international concern over the conflict's impact and human rights abuses. (Source: US).\n",
      "    *   Sudan accused the UAE of violating international conventions, implying external support for the RSF, which the UAE denies. (Source: Sudan).\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Forward-Looking Perspective**\n",
      "\n",
      "The security situation in Sudan is projected to remain highly volatile and dire in the coming year, with several critical challenges:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Continued Conflict and Destabilization:** The deep-seated animosity and strategic objectives of the SAF and RSF suggest a prolonged conflict. The RSF's demonstrated capability to conduct long-range drone strikes on critical infrastructure, including ports and energy facilities, indicates a continued threat to government-held areas and economic lifelines. The fight for control of key cities and regions, particularly in Darfur and around Khartoum, will likely intensify, leading to further destruction and loss of life.\n",
      "*   **Deepening Humanitarian Crisis:** The ongoing conflict will inevitably exacerbate the humanitarian catastrophe. Expect increased displacement, severe food insecurity, and a further breakdown of health services. The cholera outbreak and other disease risks will persist, especially with damaged infrastructure and limited access to clean water and sanitation. Attacks on aid workers and convoys will continue to impede relief efforts, making it challenging to reach vulnerable populations.\n",
      "*   **Economic Collapse:** Damage to vital infrastructure, disruption of oil exports (South Sudanese oil relies on Port Sudan), and the general instability will further cripple Sudan's economy, leading to hyperinflation, widespread poverty, and a potential for state failure.\n",
      "*   **Regional Instability:** The conflict carries a significant risk of regional destabilization, with potential for spillover effects on neighboring countries due to massive refugee flows, cross-border illicit activities, and the involvement of various armed groups. External involvement, whether direct or indirect, could further complicate peace efforts and prolong the conflict.\n",
      "*   **Challenges to Peace and Governance:** A sustainable political resolution remains elusive. The dissolution of the government and ongoing power struggles make effective governance and the establishment of a civilian-led transition extremely difficult. Accountability for human rights abuses and war crimes will be a critical, yet challenging, component of any future peace process, with the risk of impunity fueling further violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Sudan faces a profoundly challenging future marked by continued insecurity, a deepening humanitarian crisis, and significant obstacles to peace and recovery. International pressure, sustained humanitarian assistance, and concerted diplomatic efforts will be crucial, but the path to stability is long and fraught with peril.\n",

      "    *   **Targeting of Civilian and Military Facilities:** A drone attack on Port Sudan reportedly targeted civilian facilities, including an air base and a cargo warehouse, with unverified reports of power outages in parts of the city. (Source: Sudanese military, citing official)\n",
      "    *   **Oil Depot Fires:** Following these strikes, large fires erupted at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan. While the cause remains unclear and Sudanese media had not yet reported on it, the timing suggests a potential link to the preceding drone activity. (Source: Editor's note, Owen)\n",
      "    *   **Continued Air Defense Activity:** Sudanese media have subsequently reported new drone attacks on Port Sudan, with air defenses actively engaged. (Source: Sudanese media reports)\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Contested Control in Nahud:** Ground battles persist in other regions, highlighting the fluid nature of front lines and contested control.\n",
      "    *   **Conflicting Reports:** Reports from Al Arabiya, citing a Sudanese army source, assert that defenses remain in place in the city of Nahud in the south, countering social media footage purportedly showing RSF presence. Al Jazeera similarly reported a military garrison in Nahud holding out against RSF attacks. (Source: Al Arabiya, Al Jazeera) This indicates ongoing fierce fighting and contested control in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Analysis and Implications**\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent attacks on Port Sudan represent a critical escalation. This strategic port city is crucial for SAF logistics, government operations, and humanitarian aid delivery. The RSF's ability to conduct drone strikes deep into SAF-held territory demonstrates an expanding operational reach and a willingness to target vital infrastructure. The fires at oil depots, regardless of direct cause, severely impact the country's already fragile energy supply and economic stability. The situation in Nahud underscores the continued ground attrition and the difficulty in establishing clear control, reflecting the broader stalemate and fragmented nature of the conflict across Sudan.\n",

      "*   **Deepening Economic Collapse:** Damage to infrastructure, particularly energy and logistics, will further cripple Sudan's economy, leading to increased hardship for the civilian population.\n",
      "*   **Protracted Conflict:** The RSF's demonstrated capability to strike strategic targets suggests a commitment to a military solution, making a near-term political resolution increasingly unlikely. Both sides appear intent on achieving military gains.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Spread and Regional Instability:** The expansion of conflict zones, particularly to previously safer areas, indicates a potential for wider destabilization within Sudan and possible spillover effects into neighboring countries.\n",
      "*   **Challenges to Verification:** The prevalence of conflicting reports and social media footage highlights the ongoing information warfare, making accurate assessment of ground realities challenging for external observers and aid organizations.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Escalation of Conflict and Strategic Strikes on Critical Infrastructure:**\n",
      "    *   **Port Sudan Under Attack:** The RSF significantly escalated its offensive capabilities, notably employing drone strikes against Port Sudan, a vital government-controlled Red Sea port. These attacks targeted crucial facilities including **oil depots**, the **Osman Digna Air Base**, a **cargo warehouse**, and other **civilian facilities**, leading to large fires and power outages (Al Arabiya, Sudanese military, local media).\n",
      "    *   **Attacks on Airports and Energy:** Similar drone attacks were reported on **Atbara airport** in eastern Sudan, targeting a government-controlled airport and fuel depots (Sudanese military, local media). The RSF also conducted long-range drone strikes on **power stations** in Port Sudan and Omdurman, causing widespread damage to energy infrastructure (Sudanese electric utility company).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Territorial Contests and Civilian Impact:**\n",
      "    *   **Capture of En Nahud:** RSF forces reportedly captured **En Nahud** in West Kordofan, with social media footage showing RSF militia in front of local administration headquarters, though the Sudanese army maintained defenses were holding (Al Arabiya, Al Jazeera). This capture was accompanied by reports of widespread **looting, attacks on public buildings, and killing civilians** by RSF elements.\n",
      "    *   **Prison and Hospital Attacks:** A **strike on a prison** in El Obeid (Northern State) by RSF forces led to inmate releases (Sudan Doctors Union). Hospitals, such as **El Obeid Hospital**, faced shelling (RSF shelling), severely impacting healthcare access.\n",
      "    *   **Ongoing Frontlines:** Intense fighting continued for control of key areas, including **North Darfur** and **Khartoum State**, with both the SAF and RSF claiming advances and retreats.\n",

      "3.  **Deepening Humanitarian Crisis:**\n",
      "    *   **Cholera Outbreaks:** The conflict exacerbated public health crises, with a significant **cholera outbreak** reported in Khartoum and Northern State. The health ministry confirmed 727 cases and 12 deaths, highlighting the collapse of health services (health ministry).\n",
      "    *   **Aid Convoy Attacks:** Humanitarian efforts were severely hampered, as evidenced by an **attack on an aid convoy** in El Obeid, further restricting vital assistance to affected populations (UNICEF, WFP).\n",

      "The **humanitarian crisis is expected to deepen**, with increasing food insecurity, disease outbreaks, and mass displacement. Access for humanitarian aid will remain a critical challenge, exacerbated by continued attacks on convoys and infrastructure. Economically, the sustained damage will further cripple Sudan's already fragile economy, hindering any prospects for recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regionally, the conflict risks **further destabilizing the Horn of Africa**, potentially drawing in neighboring states and creating new refugee flows.

      "**Key Events and Their Security Impact (Last Year):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **April 15, 2023 – Onset of Conflict:** The sudden eruption of fighting in Khartoum between the SAF and RSF marked a catastrophic turning point. This event immediately plunged the capital into urban warfare, leading to widespread destruction, looting, and the collapse of essential services. The initial clashes quickly spread, demonstrating the deep-seated power struggle and lack of a political resolution mechanism.\n",
      "    *   **Impact:** Immediate security vacuum, mass displacement from Khartoum, breakdown of law and order, and the effective paralysis of the central government.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Escalation and Control of Khartoum (May-December 2023):** The RSF gained significant control over large parts of Khartoum, including key government and military installations, through intense street-to-street fighting. The SAF, while maintaining air superiority, struggled to dislodge the RSF from urban centers.\n",
      "    *   **Impact:** Entrenched conflict in the capital, rendering it largely uninhabitable. This solidified the de facto division of power and control, with the RSF dominating urban areas and the SAF controlling military bases and some strategic points.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Darfur's Descent into Ethnic Violence (June 2023 onwards):** The conflict in Darfur escalated dramatically, particularly in West Darfur (El Geneina) and South Darfur (Nyala). The RSF, often allied with Arab militias, launched brutal attacks against non-Arab communities, leading to widespread atrocities, mass killings, and allegations of ethnic cleansing. The fall of El Geneina to the RSF in June 2023, followed by Nyala in October, were critical events.\n",
      "    *   **Impact:** A resurgence of ethnic violence reminiscent of the early 2000s Darfur conflict. Massive internal and cross-border displacement (especially to Chad), severe humanitarian access challenges, and a deepening sense of insecurity and impunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Humanitarian Catastrophe and Famine Warnings (Throughout 2023-2024):** The conflict triggered an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Over 8.6 million people have been displaced, making Sudan the country with the largest number of internally displaced persons globally. Food insecurity has reached alarming levels, with the UN warning of impending famine in multiple regions, particularly Darfur, Khartoum, and Kordofan. Disease outbreaks (cholera, measles) have also surged due to collapsed health systems.\n",
      "    *   **Impact:** Widespread suffering, mass migration, and a severe threat to life for millions. The humanitarian crisis itself has become a major security concern, exacerbating instability and creating fertile ground for further conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Failed Peace Initiatives (Jeddah Talks, etc.):** Multiple rounds of internationally mediated talks, primarily in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, involving the SAF and RSF, have repeatedly failed to secure a lasting ceasefire or humanitarian access. Both sides have shown little willingness to compromise, often violating agreements shortly after signing.\n",
      "    *   **Impact:** Prolonged conflict due to lack of political will for peace. This failure has emboldened both parties to seek military solutions, further entrenching the conflict and diminishing prospects for a negotiated settlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Siege of El Fasher (April-May 2024):** The RSF and allied militias intensified their siege of El Fasher, North Darfur – the last major city in Darfur not under their control and a key humanitarian hub. This event threatens to unleash further catastrophic violence and displacement, as the city hosts a large number of IDPs.\n",
      "    *   **Impact:** Heightened risk of mass atrocities and a further deepening of the humanitarian crisis. It signifies the RSF's intent to consolidate control over Darfur and could lead to a new wave of ethnic violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Forward-Looking Perspective on Sudan's Future:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The immediate future of Sudan appears exceptionally bleak, with the country on a trajectory towards further fragmentation and humanitarian disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Protracted Conflict:** The conflict is deeply entrenched, with both sides seemingly committed to a military victory. This suggests a prolonged period of fighting, potentially leading to a multi-front, low-intensity conflict across vast swathes of the country.\n",
      "*   **Risk of State Collapse and Fragmentation:** The central government's authority has largely evaporated. Continued conflict risks the formal or de facto division of Sudan, with the RSF consolidating control over Darfur and parts of Kordofan, and the SAF struggling to maintain a rump state. This could lead to the emergence of multiple, competing authorities and increased localized violence.\n",
      "*   **Deepening Humanitarian Crisis:** Without a ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access, the famine warnings are likely to materialize, leading to widespread starvation and disease. This will further destabilize the region and create immense pressure on neighboring countries.\n",
      "*   **Regional Spillover:** The conflict has already generated massive refugee flows into Chad, Egypt, South Sudan, and Ethiopia. A prolonged crisis risks further destabilizing these already fragile states, potentially drawing in regional actors and creating new proxy conflicts.\n",
      "*   **No Clear Path to Peace:** The failure of mediation efforts highlights the immense challenge of finding a political solution. A credible, inclusive civilian-led transition remains elusive, and the military actors show little interest in relinquishing power.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Sudan stands at a critical precipice. The events of the last year have dismantled the state, unleashed horrific violence, and pushed millions to the brink of survival. Without urgent, concerted international pressure for a genuine ceasefire, unhindered humanitarian access, and a credible political process that includes civilian voices, Sudan faces a future of continued conflict, fragmentation, and an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe.\n",
