Between late April and late June 2025, Russian military intercepted hundreds of Ukrainian drones over Bryansk Oblast, with the number of interceptions varying significantly each night. While most interceptions occurred without casualties, there were instances where Ukrainian drones struck civilian vehicles, agricultural enterprises, and infrastructure, resulting in injuries and damage. Notable incidents include the detonation of explosives on a railway bridge on 31 May 2025, which caused a train derailment and resulted in 7 deaths and 127 injuries.

      "First, there's an event on 21 May 2025 where partisans of the Skrepach movement burned down a power substation in Grozny, which is in Chechnya. That's a significant infrastructure destruction. Then, around 2 May 2025, Chechen police abducted and tortured a man in Urus-Martan. They wanted him to join Russian forces in Ukraine, but he escaped. After that, the police took two of his relatives. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should note the exact dates and locations as given. The power substation attack is a clear case of property destruction. The abduction and torture are human rights violations and indicate security issues. The man's escape and subsequent abduction of his relatives show ongoing tensions and possible retaliation.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, in the analysis, I'll mention the two incidents, their dates, locations, and the implications. I'll note that there are no casualties mentioned, but significant impacts like infrastructure damage and human rights abuses. The patterns show increased violent events, with a 200% increase predicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure I don't infer anything beyond what's written. No speculation about why the Skrepach movement did what they did or the broader context. Just the facts as given.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also check that I'm using the exact numbers from the JSON data and not adding any others. The percentage is 200%, and the events go from 1 to 3.\n",
