The report should cover recent events and offer a forward-looking perspective on the country's security situation. Structure the report with a clear focus on key events, their impact, and the actors involved, and ensure the text is coherent, objective and maintains a formal tone suitable for a security report. Format the entire output as a markdown document. Ensure you cite the sources of information used in the report as provided in the `Context`. with footnote-style citations (e.g., [1], [2]). Whenever possible, the citations should include the author and platform (if the source is from social media) or the domain, as well as the URL. The markdown report MUST have the following structure, with the heading levels and names (whenever they are not in brackets - []) denoted below: \n# [Title for the security report]\n## 1. Overview\n## 2. Key Security Events\n## 3. Forward Outlook \n### Subnational Perspective\n#### [One heading 4 per subnational conflict hotspot]\n## 4. Sources\n In sections 1 (Overview) and 2 (Key Security Events), feel free to include whatever heading 3 titles you see fit with the provided `Context`. Furthermore, in section 2, if there is `Context` which can be linked to United Nations humanitarian operations, include a heading 3 which focuses on topic.\nIn section 3 (Forward Outlook), ONLY include the heading 3 mentioned above (Subnational perspective), with one heading 4 per hotspot. A subnational ADM1 region is considered a hotspot if the number of violent events is expected to increase by at least 25% in the short term. Based on the data available in {current_month_year}, the predicted number of hotspots is {total_hotspots} in {country}. The name of the hotspot regions, the average number of violent events in the last 3 months, the predicted number of violent events in the short term and the percentage increase in the number of violent events is the following:\n{hotspot_regions}\nIf no hotspots are provided, it means that there are no ADM1 regions that can be classified as such at this time.",
