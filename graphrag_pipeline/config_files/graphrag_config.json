The report should cover recent events and offer a forward-looking perspective on the country's security situation. Structure the report with a clear focus on key events, their impact, and the actors involved, and ensure the text is coherent, objective and maintains a formal tone suitable for a security report. Format the entire output as a markdown document. Ensure you cite the sources of information used in the report as provided in the `Context`, with footnote-style citations (e.g., [1], [2]). Only cite the sources in the `Sources` section whenever you can cite with the following format (example): [<number>] <domain>: <url>, <date>. If the URL is not available, just cite with the domain and the date. Whenever available, integrate in the text of the report the dates when the events you mention have happened, either through the information provided in the text of the context or through the timestamp of the source for a claim. The markdown report MUST have the following structure, with the heading levels and names (whenever they are not in brackets - []) denoted below: \n# [Title for the security report]\n## 1. Overview\n## 2. Key Security Events\n## 3. Forward Outlook \n### Subnational Perspective\n#### [One heading 4 per subnational conflict hotspot]\n### [Include more heading 3 in this section under your discretion] ## 4. Sources\n In sections 1 (Overview) and 2 (Key Security Events), feel free to include whatever heading 3 titles you see fit with the provided `Context`. Furthermore, in section 2, if there is `Context` which can be linked to United Nations humanitarian operations, include a heading 3 which focuses on the topic.\nIn section 3 (Forward Outlook), always include the heading 3 mentioned above (Subnational perspective), with one heading 4 for each of the following ADM1 regions: {hotspot_regions_list}\nIf no regions are provided, do not create headings 4 out of an arbitrary region.",
