    "You must pass either start_date and end_date, or timespan.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `start_date` - The start date for the filter in YYYY-MM-DD format or as a datetime object in UTC time. Passing a datetime allows you to specify a time down to seconds granularity. The API officially only supports the most recent 3 months of articles. Making a request for an earlier date range may still return data, but it's not guaranteed.\n",
    "- `end_date` - The end date for the filter in YYYY-MM-DD format or as a datetime object in UTC time.\n",
    "- `timespan` - A timespan to search for, relative to the time of the request. Must match one of the API's timespan formats - https://blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-doc-2-0-api-debuts/\n",
    "- `num_records` - The number of records to return. Only used in article list mode and can be up to 250.\n",
    "- `keyword` - Return articles containing the exact phrase keyword within the article text.\n",
    "- `domain` - Return articles from the specified domain. Does not require an exact match so passing \"cnn.com\" will match articles from cnn.com, subdomain.cnn.com and notactuallycnn.com.\n",
    "- `domain_exact` - Similar to domain, but requires an exact match.\n",
    "- `country` - Return articles published in a country or list of countries, formatted as the FIPS 2 letter country code.\n",
    "- `language` - Return articles published in the given language, formatted as the ISO 639 language code.\n",
    "- `theme` - Return articles that cover one of GDELT's GKG Themes. A full list of themes can be found here\n",
    "- `near` - Return articles containing words close to each other in the text. Use near() to construct. eg. near = near(5, \"airline\", \"climate\"), or multi_near() if you want to use multiple restrictions eg. multi_near([(5, \"airline\", \"crisis\"), (10, \"airline\", \"climate\", \"change\")], method=\"AND\") finds \"airline\" and \"crisis\" within 5 words, and \"airline\", \"climate\", and \"change\" within 10 words\n",
    "- `repeat` - Return articles containing a single word repeated at least a number of times. Use repeat() to construct. eg. repeat =repeat(3, \"environment\"), or multi_repeat() if you want to use multiple restrictions eg. repeat = multi_repeat([(2, \"airline\"), (3, \"airport\")], \"AND\")\n",
    "- `tone` - Return articles above or below a particular tone score (ie more positive or more negative than a certain threshold). To use, specify either a greater than or less than sign and a positive or negative number (either an integer or floating point number). To find fairly positive articles, use tone=\">5\" or to search for fairly negative articles, use tone=\"<-5\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tone_absolute` - The same as tone but ignores the positive/negative sign and lets you search for high emotion or low emotion articles, regardless of whether they were happy or sad in tone"

    "\n",
    "The article discusses the escalating financial toll of the ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan, highlighting the following key points:\n",
    "- Defense Budgets: India’s defense budget for 2025 is approximately $86.1 billion, marking a 1.6% increase from the previous year. In contrast, Pakistan’s defense budget stands at about $10.2 billion.\n",
    "- Military Operations: India launched ‘Operation Sindoora,’ targeting nine locations associated with terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan. In retaliation, Pakistan conducted drone strikes and bombings on multiple Indian cities.\n",
    "-\tEconomic Disparity: The article highlights the significant disparity in defense spending between the two countries. India’s substantial investment in military modernization and infrastructure contrasts with Pakistan’s reliance on foreign aid due to its struggling economy.\n",
    "-\tGlobal Rankings: According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), India now ranks as the fifth-largest country globally in terms of military budgeting and spending."
