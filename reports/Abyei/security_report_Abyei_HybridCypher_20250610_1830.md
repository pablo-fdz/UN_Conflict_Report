Based on the provided context, there is **no information or mention of Abyei** or any security events related to it in the last year. The provided data focuses on security incidents in various parts of Sudan (e.g., Nahud, Port Sudan, El Obeid, Khartoum, Darfur) and some areas of South Sudan (e.g., Old Fangak).

Therefore, I cannot generate a security report for Abyei as requested, as there are no relevant events to center the report around or to provide a forward-looking perspective on its future based on the given information.
