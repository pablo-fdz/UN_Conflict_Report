## Security Report: Abyei (Past Year and Future Outlook)

### Recent Events:

The past year in Abyei has been characterized by persistent and often escalating inter-communal violence, primarily between the Ngok Dinka and Twic Dinka communities, alongside ongoing, albeit less frequent, tensions with the Misseriya. These events have significantly shaped the security landscape:

*   **Escalation of Ngok Dinka-Twic Dinka Violence (Late 2023 - Early 2024):** This has been the most devastating security trend. Throughout late 2023 and particularly in January and February 2024, the southern parts of the Abyei Area, especially around Agok and Aneet, witnessed intense clashes. These conflicts, driven by unresolved border demarcation, land disputes, and cattle raiding, resulted in numerous fatalities, injuries, and the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians. Villages were attacked and destroyed, and humanitarian access was severely hampered. The violence also led to attacks on UNISFA peacekeepers, highlighting the challenging operational environment (S/2023/899, S/2024/309).
*   **Persistent Misseriya-Ngok Dinka Tensions:** While not reaching the same level of intensity as the Dinka-Dinka clashes, the annual migration of Misseriya pastoralists through Abyei continued to be a source of friction. Incidents related to cattle raiding and competition over resources were reported, though UNISFA's facilitation of dialogue and monitoring efforts helped mitigate larger-scale confrontations (S/2024/309).
*   **Indirect Impact of the Sudan Conflict:** The ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan has indirectly affected Abyei. It has diverted attention and resources from the final status negotiations for Abyei, further stalling political progress. While direct spillover into Abyei has been limited, the broader regional instability poses a long-term risk (S/2023/899).
*   **Challenges to UNISFA's Mandate:** The United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) continued its critical role in protecting civilians and facilitating peace. However, the force faced significant challenges, including attacks on its personnel and limitations in fully implementing its mandate due to the complex nature of the inter-communal conflicts and the lack of political will from Sudan and South Sudan to resolve Abyei's final status (UNSC Resolution 2709, S/2024/309).

### Future Outlook:

Based on the recent trends and the unresolved underlying issues, the security situation in Abyei is likely to face continued challenges, with limited prospects for a swift resolution of its final status:

*   **Continued Inter-communal Violence:** Without a comprehensive political settlement, effective disarmament, and robust reconciliation efforts, the Ngok Dinka-Twic Dinka conflict is highly likely to persist, leading to further casualties and displacement. Tensions with the Misseriya will also remain a recurring concern, particularly during migration seasons.
*   **Protracted Humanitarian Crisis:** The ongoing violence and displacement will exacerbate the humanitarian situation, leading to increased food insecurity, limited access to basic services, and a continued reliance on humanitarian aid.
*   **Stalled Political Process:** The final status of Abyei is unlikely to be resolved in the short to medium term. The internal conflicts in both Sudan and South Sudan mean that Abyei remains a low priority for both sovereign states, perpetuating the political vacuum that fuels instability.
*   **Critical Role of UNISFA:** UNISFA will remain indispensable for civilian protection, monitoring, and facilitating local peace initiatives. Its effectiveness will continue to depend on sustained international support and improved cooperation from the governments of Sudan and South Sudan.
*   **Potential for Regional Spillover:** The broader instability in Sudan could indirectly impact Abyei, potentially leading to increased movements of armed groups, resource competition, or a further breakdown of governance structures in the wider border region.
*   **Fragile Local Peace Initiatives:** While challenging, there remains a potential for local leaders and communities, supported by UNISFA and humanitarian actors, to engage in dialogue and de-escalation efforts. However, these initiatives are often fragile and require sustained commitment.

This report provides a summary of recent events in Abyei. A comprehensive security assessment requires further investigation and analysis.
