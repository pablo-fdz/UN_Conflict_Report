## Sudan Security Report: A Year of Escalation and Humanitarian Crisis

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on provided context, reflecting events up to this point)

### Executive Summary

The past year in Sudan has been dominated by the escalating civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), marked by intensified fighting, a significant rise in drone warfare, and a deepening humanitarian catastrophe. Events have centered on strategic urban centers and critical infrastructure, with devastating consequences for the civilian population. The outlook remains grim, with continued conflict and a worsening humanitarian situation anticipated in the absence of a political resolution.

### Key Events (Last Year)

1.  **Escalation of Conflict and Drone Warfare:**
    *   **Port Sudan Under Attack:** The RSF significantly expanded its operational reach, launching unprecedented drone strikes on Port Sudan, a vital government-controlled port city. These attacks, described as the first of their kind in the civil war, targeted civilian facilities, including an air base (Osman Digna Air Base) and cargo warehouses. Large fires at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan were reported following RSF drone strikes, indicating a focus on critical energy infrastructure. The Sudanese army's anti-aircraft networks were actively engaged in intercepting drones, particularly near the naval base and airport, leading to temporary suspensions of air traffic.
    *   **Widespread Drone Activity:** Beyond Port Sudan, RSF drone strikes were reported across various states, targeting prisons (e.g., in White Nile state), infrastructure, fuel depots, and military installations in locations such as Omdurman, Kosti, and Al-Khawi. Long-range RSF drone strikes also hit power stations in Omdurman.
    *   **SAF Counter-Operations:** The SAF responded with its own drone strikes and ground operations, targeting RSF weapons and fuel stockpiles (e.g., near Nyala Airport) and conducting airstrikes in areas like El Khawi and Omdurman.

2.  **Intensified Ground Clashes and Control Shifts:**
    *   **North Kordofan Front:** Intense ground fighting continued, notably in North Kordofan. The RSF captured En Nahud, leading to widespread looting, attacks on public buildings, and civilian casualties. The capture of a prison in En Nahud and the subsequent release of inmates further destabilized the region.
    *   **Khartoum State Battles:** The battle for control of Khartoum State, including Omdurman, remained fierce. While the Sudanese army reported gains and claimed to have recaptured areas and liberated captives, fighting persisted, marked by heavy shelling and airstrikes.
    *   **Darfur and Other Regions:** Clashes were also reported in Darfur (e.g., Al Fashir, Nyala) and other regions like Heiban, where the army reported gains against the RSF.

3.  **Deepening Humanitarian Catastrophe:**
    *   **Attacks on Healthcare:** The conflict severely impacted healthcare infrastructure. Hospitals were directly targeted, with reports of RSF shelling El Obeid Hospital and attacks on main hospitals in Old Fangak, Merowe, and El Khawi.
    *   **Cholera Outbreak:** A significant cholera outbreak emerged, affecting North Kordofan and Khartoum, with the health ministry reporting 727 cases and 12 deaths. Humanitarian efforts saw the arrival of 2.9 million doses of oral cholera vaccine in Port Sudan.
    *   **Aid Obstruction and Displacement:** Aid convoys, including those from UNICEF and WFP, were attacked in areas like El Khawi, hindering critical humanitarian assistance. Widespread displacement continued, exacerbated by fighting and the burning of villages (e.g., eight villages in Heiban area). The discovery of mass graves and 465 bodies underscored the scale of civilian suffering.

4.  **Political and External Dynamics:**
    *   **Internal Governance:** The Sudanese government denied losing control of towns like Nahud amidst the fighting. There were reports of a sweeping reshuffle of key state government positions and a government dissolution.
    *   **International Scrutiny:** The US indicated its intention to impose sanctions on Sudan. Sudan, in turn, accused the UAE of violating international conventions, with reports suggesting UAE ships cooperated with the RSF, highlighting potential external involvement in the conflict.

### Forward-Looking Perspective

The security situation in Sudan is poised for continued volatility and deterioration in the coming year.

*   **Persistent Conflict:** The SAF and RSF remain entrenched in a brutal power struggle, with no clear victor or immediate signs of a political breakthrough. Fighting is expected to persist, particularly around strategic locations like Port Sudan, Khartoum, and key supply routes. The reliance on drone warfare is likely to increase, posing continued threats to civilian infrastructure and populations.
*   **Worsening Humanitarian Crisis:** The humanitarian situation will almost certainly worsen. Attacks on aid workers and infrastructure, coupled with ongoing displacement and disease outbreaks (like cholera), will exacerbate an already dire crisis. Access to essential services, including healthcare and food, will remain severely constrained.
*   **Economic Collapse:** The sustained conflict, damage to infrastructure (especially oil depots and ports), and disruption of trade will further cripple Sudan's economy, leading to increased poverty and instability. The contingency plan for oil suspension, if implemented, would have severe economic repercussions.
*   **Regional Instability:** The conflict's spillover effects, including refugee flows and potential regional proxy dynamics, will continue to destabilize neighboring countries. External actors' involvement, whether through sanctions or alleged support to belligerents, will shape the conflict's trajectory.

Without a concerted and effective international effort to broker a lasting ceasefire and facilitate a political transition, Sudan faces a prolonged period of insecurity, humanitarian catastrophe, and fragmentation. The future of the country remains highly uncertain, with the risk of further state collapse and regional destabilization.
