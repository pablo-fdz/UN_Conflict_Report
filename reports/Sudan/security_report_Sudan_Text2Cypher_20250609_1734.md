## Security Report: Sudan (Past Year and Future Outlook)

### Overview

The past year in Sudan has been defined by the devastating conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), leading to a severe humanitarian crisis, widespread infrastructure damage, and profound political instability. Events on the ground highlight a deepening crisis with no immediate end in sight.

### Key Events in the Past Year

**1. Escalation of Conflict and Drone Warfare:**
The conflict has seen a significant escalation, marked by the RSF's increased use of drone warfare. Port Sudan, a critical Red Sea port and the de facto government seat, became a frequent target. Multiple **suspected RSF drone attacks** struck the city's airport, naval base, fuel depots, power stations, and warehouses, leading to flight suspensions and widespread power outages [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]. Other key areas, including El Obeid, Kosti, Atbara, Merowe, and Kassala, also faced **drone strikes** and **clashes**, with reports of RSF seizing control in Nahud [5, 10, 22, 23, 26, 30, 33, 44, 51, 52].

**2. Devastating Humanitarian Impact:**
The conflict has exacted a catastrophic toll on civilians.
*   **Attacks on Aid Convoys:** Humanitarian efforts have been severely hampered by attacks on aid convoys. A WFP and UNICEF convoy delivering life-saving supplies near Al Koma came **under attack**, resulting in multiple casualties and the deaths of five members, with several trucks burned [53, 54].
*   **Civilian Casualties:** Civilian areas, including markets and displacement camps, have been directly targeted. **At least 19 people were killed** in RSF attacks in El Fasher and Abu Shouk Camp in North Darfur [7]. A drone strike near a market in Al-Koma resulted in **89 people killed and injured** [19]. Other attacks in El Khawi, Al-Dabaibat, and Omdurman also caused civilian deaths and injuries [20, 21, 37].
*   **Attacks on Healthcare and Prisons:** Medical facilities have not been spared. The main hospital in El Obeid was **damaged in a suspected RSF attack and forced to close** [5]. A prison in El Obeid was also struck, killing **at least 21 people** and injuring 47 [18, 31, 32].
*   **Disease Outbreaks:** Beyond direct conflict, the health crisis is severe. Sudan's health ministry reported **12 deaths and 727 cholera cases** identified across the country as of May 31 [4].
*   **Displacement and Refugee Concerns:** The ongoing violence has led to massive displacement. The Syrian government announced plans to **send representatives to Sudan to assess conditions for and make necessary evacuations** of its refugees [17].

**3. Political Instability:**
Amidst the raging conflict, Sudan's political landscape remains highly volatile. The transitional Prime Minister Kamil Idriss **dissolved the government** shortly after taking oath, tasking ministry secretaries with interim responsibilities until a new government is formed [3]. This action further deepens the political vacuum and uncertainty regarding governance.

**4. Economic Vulnerability:**
The targeting of critical infrastructure, particularly in Port Sudan, poses a significant threat to Sudan's economy and regional stability. The Sudanese government has drafted **contingency plans to suspend the import and export of oil from South Sudan** if the oil transit system is further compromised by RSF strikes, highlighting the fragility of key economic lifelines [28].

### Forward-Looking Perspective

The outlook for Sudan remains grim, with several critical challenges on the horizon:

*   **Protracted Conflict:** The immediate future points to a continuation of the armed conflict. Both the SAF and RSF are likely to persist in their military strategies, including drone warfare and targeting of strategic locations, leading to sustained violence and instability.
*   **Deepening Humanitarian Crisis:** The humanitarian situation is expected to worsen significantly. Continued attacks on aid workers and infrastructure will further impede humanitarian access, exacerbating food insecurity, displacement, and the spread of diseases like cholera. Millions will remain in dire need of assistance.
*   **Economic Collapse:** Damage to critical infrastructure, especially ports and oil transit routes, threatens to cripple Sudan's already fragile economy. This will lead to further hardship, inflation, and potential regional economic repercussions if South Sudanese oil exports are halted.
*   **Political Vacuum and Governance Challenges:** The dissolution of the government and the absence of a stable political framework suggest a prolonged period of political uncertainty. This vacuum makes any meaningful peace negotiations, national reconciliation, or post-conflict reconstruction efforts extremely challenging.
*   **Regional Spillover:** The conflict's impact could extend beyond Sudan's borders, leading to increased refugee flows into neighboring countries, further destabilizing an already fragile region.

A sustainable resolution for Sudan requires a concerted international effort to pressure the warring parties into a comprehensive ceasefire, ensure unhindered humanitarian access, and facilitate an inclusive political process that involves all Sudanese stakeholders. Without such intervention, Sudan risks a protracted conflict with catastrophic consequences for its people and the wider region.
