# Sudan Security Report: Escalating Conflict and Regional Instability


## 1. Overview
Sudan is experiencing an ongoing security crisis characterized by instability and conflict [2, 36]. This crisis is primarily driven by the ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) [10]. Violent events have notably increased in regions such as Blue Nile, River Nile, and West Darfur [2]. Recent events indicate a spread of conflict activity to new regions, including airstrikes in Nyala and El Geneina (Darfur), el-Obeid, and reports of RSF militia in Nahud, alongside increased activity in areas such as River Nile, Khartoum, and Northern states [5]. Hostilities have intensified [13], marked by an increased reliance on drone warfare [42]. Key areas of engagement include Khartoum State [28], Darfur [31], and the strategically vital Port Sudan [19, 13, 14]. While specific data to quantify civilian casualties is not available, the ongoing conflict and intensifying hostilities suggest a high likelihood of civilian impact. Damage to infrastructure has been observed, particularly in Port Sudan, where energy infrastructure, including oil depots, and an ammunition depot have been targeted [36]. The intensification of hostilities and increased violent events in several regions imply a worsening humanitarian situation. Political instability persists within Sudan [21, 35], with reports of reshuffles in South Sudan's state governments amidst the regional turmoil [21].

### Current Conflict Dynamics
The conflict is characterized by intense fighting for control of key urban centers [33, 23, 22, 28] and strategic infrastructure [37]. The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are engaged in large-scale operations to reclaim territories [30], while the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continue to employ drone [5] and artillery attacks [34], targeting both military [41] and civilian facilities [7]. The use of drones by the RSF has become a prominent feature of the conflict [6, 39]. These drone operations have impacted critical infrastructure, including airports [5, 45] and oil depots [11]. Naval bases have also been targeted by RSF drone attacks, though the full extent of the impact is not detailed [18].

## 2. Key Security Events
### Intensified Fighting in Khartoum State
The Sudanese army has reported ongoing "large-scale operations" aimed at reclaiming all of Khartoum State from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) [27]. Fighting persists in Khartoum State, particularly in the south and west of Omdurman [29]. Explosions and clashes have been reported in Omdurman as the army works to dislodge the RSF from remaining positions [4]. The RSF has also reportedly targeted the University of Khartoum in Omdurman with explosive drones [9].

### Strategic Attacks on Port Sudan
Port Sudan, a critical Red Sea port and the country's main economic gateway, has been subjected to a wave of RSF paramilitary drone attacks [46]. These attacks have led to the suspension of all flights at Port Sudan airport [3]. Pro-government Sudanese media has alleged that RSF drone attacks caused a fire at an oil refinery in Port Sudan, though the extent of damage to multiple depots is not fully substantiated [13]. The Sudanese civil defense has reported that these fires are now "completely" under control [36]. Further drone strikes have been reported targeting civilian facilities, including an air base and a cargo warehouse [44]. A total power outage in Port Sudan was confirmed by the Sudanese electric utility company due to damage to energy infrastructure from RSF paramilitary drone attacks [37]. A naval base in Port Sudan was also reportedly hit by a drone attack [2]. The Sudanese government has drafted contingency plans to suspend the import and export of oil from South Sudan in the event of further RSF strikes destabilizing the oil transit system, which has already seen impacts on pump stations, depots, and port facilities [11].

### Conflict in Darfur and Other Regions
In Darfur, the Sudanese army has conducted airstrikes targeting RSF positions in Nyala and El Geneina [49, 49]. Near El Fasher in North Darfur, RSF drone and artillery attacks reportedly killed seven people, with additional injuries reported, as fighting continues for control of the region [32]. Beyond Darfur, a drone attack was reported on Atbara in River Nile state [40]. The RSF also attacked the city of Nahud in Sudan's South Kordofan province [5]. Separately, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement–North (SPLM-N) militant group accused the military of burning eight villages in the Heiban area of South Kordofan in early May [25].

### Emergence of New Armed Groups
In response to the deteriorating security situation, three Sudanese armed groups have reportedly joined forces to form a militia aimed at protecting Sudan's Um Gargour eastern border area with Eritrea [47].

### United Nations Humanitarian Operations
The ongoing conflict has severely impacted humanitarian efforts. There are reports of an attack on an aid convoy, in which UNICEF and WFP participated [17]. Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has facilitated the arrival of 2.9 million doses of oral vaccine against cholera in Port Sudan, highlighting the public health challenges exacerbated by the conflict [48].

## 3. Forward Outlook
The security situation in Sudan is expected to remain highly volatile in the short term [1], with continued clashes between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) [24]. Khartoum is anticipated to remain a focal point of intense conflict [8]. Port Sudan, a key area of engagement, has been subjected to drone attacks, including on its naval base and airport, leading to the suspension of flights [43].The RSF has utilized drones in their attacks, targeting various locations including civilian facilities and airports [26, 15]. Reports indicate the RSF paramilitary forces have used advanced foreign air defense systems [26, 15]. RSF drone attacks have impacted critical infrastructure, such as a power station and Port Sudan airport [43], and have resulted in civilian casualties and damage [38].The potential disruption of oil transit from South Sudan through Port Sudan is a concern. The Sudanese government has drafted contingency plans to suspend oil transit from South Sudan through Port Sudan due to potential RSF strikes that could destabilize the system [20]. Recent drone strikes have impacted facilities in Port Sudan, and the Sudanese government has warned South Sudan about the compromised transportation system, indicating they would be unable to facilitate the export of South Sudanese oil if the system is further compromised [16].### Armed Conflict Probability Forecast (Conflict Forecast)According to ConflictForecast, the predicted probability of armed conflict in Sudan in the next 3 months is 99.61%.*This prediction represents the risk that a country suffers an outbreak of armed conflict within the next three months, i.e. that the country goes from no fatalities to over 0.5 fatalities per one million inhabitants within a time horizon of three months.*The following chart displays the armed conflict risk trend since 2020 until the present day:![Conflict Forecast Time Series](assets/LineChart_Sudan_2025-07-02-23-10-27.svg)### Subnational PerspectiveSeveral subnational ADM1 regions are predicted to experience a significant increase in violent events, classifying them as conflict hotspots [1]. The projected increases underscore the widespread nature of the conflict and the potential for further destabilization across the country.#### Predicted Increase in Violent Events in the Short Term (ACLED)ACLED CAST predicts several ADM1 regions in Sudan to be hotspots for violent events in the next calendar month (August, 2025) [1].*An ADM1 region is considered to be a hotspot if the predicted increase in the number of violent events in the next month compared to the 3-month average is at least of 25%.*The chart below shows regions with a predicted change in violent events.![ACLED Hotspots Bar Chart](assets/BarChart_Sudan_2025-07-02-23-10-14.svg)Considering the hotspot criteria, the following regions are expected to have a significant increase in violent events in August, 2025:| Region | Avg. # Violent Events (3 months) | Forecasted # Violent Events | % Increase ||---|---|---|---|| West Darfur | 2 | 4 | 100.0% || River Nile | 2 | 6 | 200.0% || Khartoum | 33 | 49 | 48.5% || Northern | 7 | 9 | 28.6% || Sennar | 2 | 4 | 100.0% || Aj Jazirah | 7 | 12 | 71.4% || Blue Nile | 1 | 5 | 400.0% || Central Darfur | 5 | 7 | 40.0% || Gedaref | 0 | 3 | 30.0% |#### West DarfurWest Darfur is projected to see a 100% increase in violent events, with the predicted number rising from an average of 2.0 events in the last three months to 4.0 events in the short term [1]. This indicates a significant escalation of conflict in the region.#### River NileThe River Nile state is forecast to experience a 200% increase in violent events, with the predicted number rising from an average of 2.0 to 6.0 events [1]. This substantial increase suggests a heightened risk of instability in an area previously less affected by direct conflict.#### KhartoumKhartoum, the capital, is expected to witness a 48.48% increase in violent events, with the predicted number rising from an average of 33.0 to 49.0 events [1]. This indicates continued intense fighting and instability in the metropolitan area.#### NorthernThe Northern state is projected to see a 28.57% increase in violent events, with the predicted number rising from an average of 7.0 to 9.0 events [1]. This modest but notable increase suggests a growing security concern in this region.#### SennarSennar is forecast to experience a 100% increase in violent events, with the predicted number rising from an average of 2.0 to 4.0 events [1]. This significant escalation points to a deteriorating security environment.#### Aj JazirahAj Jazirah is projected to see a 71.42% increase in violent events, with the predicted number rising from an average of 7.0 to 12.0 events [1]. This substantial increase highlights a worsening security situation in the region.#### Blue NileThe Blue Nile state is forecast to experience a dramatic 400% increase in violent events, with the predicted number rising from an average of 1.0 to 5.0 events [1]. This indicates a severe and rapid deterioration of security.#### Central DarfurCentral Darfur is projected to see a 40% increase in violent events, with the predicted number rising from an average of 5.0 to 7.0 events [1]. This suggests a continued and intensifying conflict in the Darfur region.#### GedarefGedaref is forecast to experience a 30% increase in violent events, with the predicted number rising from an average of 0.0 to 3.0 events [1]. While starting from a low base, this indicates the emergence of new security challenges in the area.

[11] Editor's note: Local media is reporting that the Sudanese government has drafted contingency plans to suspend the import and export of oil from South Sudan in the event of further RSF strikes to destabilize the oil transit system. Recent drone strikes have impacted pump stations, depots and port facilities on the Red Sea.
[12] Editor's note: Military sources have told Al Jazeera that Khartoum State, Sudan, has been recaptured in full from the RSF militia by the army. A short while ago an official said that the Sudan army was "close" to recapturing all of Khartoum State, but there was also still fighting reported in Omdurman. We will update when we have a citable source confirming the army is claiming to have retaken the whole state. -Sarah
[13] Editor's note: We are aware of images circulating on social media of a large fire burning at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan, Sudan. The attack has not yet been reported on by Sudanese media, and the cause of the fires is still unclear. The fires come just one day after a series of RSF paramilitary drone strikes in the city, which were the first of the country's two year civil war. We are watching our sources for more information. - Owen
