# Sudan Security Report: A Year in Review and Outlook


## Overview
Sudan has experienced a year of intense conflict [1], primarily characterized by the ongoing civil war between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) [1, 2]. This period has been marked by intense hostilities, impacting critical infrastructure [3, 4] and civilian populations [5] across the country. While specific details on the direct impact on humanitarian efforts are not fully available, the documented effects on infrastructure and civilians indicate a likely impediment to aid operations.

## Key Security Events
### Intensified Conflict and Targeting of Infrastructure

The conflict has been characterized by drone strikes [6] and ground assaults [7]. Drone strikes have specifically targeted strategic locations and civilian facilities [8], [9].

*   **Port Sudan**: The city has been a primary target for RSF paramilitary drone strikes [10], which were the first of their kind in the country's two-year civil war [11]. These strikes have hit civilian facilities, including an air base and a cargo warehouse [12], [2], [13]. Large fires at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan have followed these drone strikes [14], [15]. Sudanese media have also reported subsequent drone attacks in the city, met with active air defense responses [16], [1].
*   **Nahud**: In Nahud, ongoing confrontations have been reported [17]. The Sudanese army has maintained defensive positions against RSF attacks in the city [18], [19], even as social media footage has purportedly shown RSF militia in front of local administration headquarters [20].
*   **Khartoum State & Omdurman**: The struggle for control of Khartoum State persists [21], with the Sudanese army reporting advances and the recapture of areas such as Al-Khawi [22], [23]. Additionally, RSF drone strikes have targeted power stations in Omdurman [24].
*   **Other Areas**:
    *   **En Nahud**: In En Nahud, RSF forces captured a prison, resulting in the release of inmates [25], [26]. They have also been implicated in looting, attacking public buildings, and killing civilians in the vicinity [27], [28], [29].
    *   **El Obeid**: RSF shelling has affected El Obeid Hospital [30].
    *   **El Fasher**: An RSF attack was reported in the Shagra area of El Fasher [31].
    *   **Nyala**: At Nyala Airport, the Sudanese government was involved in the destruction of a plane [23]. Unnamed Sudanese military sources have claimed to have bombed RSF weapons and fuel stockpiles at the same location [24], [33].
    *   **Kassala**: The RSF has targeted the government-controlled airport in Kassala, with reports indicating that drones were shot down [25], [26].
    *   **Old Fangak**: A Twitter/X account, purporting to represent the Naath Defense Forces, reported that the government of South Sudan launched airstrikes on Nuer civilian areas in Old Fangak and nearby villages; however, this claim could not be independently verified [36], [37].

### Humanitarian and Social Impact

*   **Health Crisis**: A cholera outbreak has been reported [38], with Sudan's health ministry reporting 727 cases and 12 deaths as of May 31, though other reports indicate higher fatalities [39]. Cases and deaths have been particularly noted in Khartoum and North Kordofan [40], [41]. The WHO has facilitated the delivery of 2.9 million doses of oral cholera vaccine to Port Sudan [30]. Hospitals have been subjected to bombing [42], [43], including MSF's hospital in Old Fangak [31].
*   **Infrastructure Damage**: Widespread power cuts have impacted cities such as Port Sudan, Khartoum, and Wadi Halfa [33], [33], [33]. These outages are attributed to damage to energy infrastructure [33].
*   **Displacement and Aid**: Assessments of refugee conditions have been conducted [38]. Reports also indicate attacks on aid convoys involving UNICEF and WFP [37], [37].

### External Relations and Political Developments

*   **International Sanctions**: The United States is reportedly preparing to impose sanctions on Sudan [49].
*   **Allegations Against UAE**: Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of violating international conventions, alleging that UAE ships have cooperated with the RSF [39], [40].
*   **Government Changes**: A significant reshuffle of key state government positions has taken place in Warrap, Central Equatoria, and Upper Nile [41], [42], [43]. Furthermore, a government dissolution occurred, followed by an oath-taking ceremony involving Sudan's transitional Prime Minister Kamil Idriss [43], [44].

## Forward-Looking Perspective
Based on the events of the past year, the security situation in Sudan is likely to remain volatile. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have utilized drone strikes [45] and targeted critical infrastructure [46], actions that suggest an ongoing strategy to disrupt government control. While these actions have led to disruptions, the specific intent to exert pressure as a strategic objective is not explicitly confirmed by available information. Concurrently, the Sudanese army is making efforts to regain control in various areas [21], which indicates a protracted conflict [1]. The conflict has led to indications of a severe humanitarian impact, including health crises such as a cholera outbreak and attacks on hospitals [47, 48], as well as damage to infrastructure [47]. While the current situation demonstrates significant humanitarian challenges, information is insufficient to definitively project the persistence of this impact. The severe humanitarian situation underscores the importance of international aid and attention, though the necessity for their continuation at specific levels is not explicitly detailed. Allegations of external support for the RSF exist [6], and international sanctions have been imposed [49]. These allegations of external support may contribute to the complexity of the conflict dynamics [6] and have been noted in the context of international relations. Similarly, the imposition of international sanctions may influence conflict dynamics and are part of the broader international context. The ongoing nature of the conflict suggests continued instability. The absence of a political resolution is also a factor contributing to the likelihood of continued instability.

10. Editor's note: We are aware of images circulating on social media of a large fire burning at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan, Sudan. The attack has not yet been reported on by Sudanese media, and the cause of the fires is still unclear. The fires come just one day after a series of RSF paramilitary drone strikes in the city, which were the first of the country's two year civil war. We are watching our sources for more information. - Owen
11. Editor's note: Pro-government Sudanese media outlet Sudan Akhbar are alleging that the fire burning at an oil refinery in Port Sudan was sparked by an RSF drone attack. They do not provide a source for this claim, instead claiming to have access to eyewitness videos not linked in the article. The allegation would track with yesterday's RSF attack on the Port Sudan airport and nearby military base. We are watching for confirmation of RSF's involvement in the fire. - Owen
