# Sudan Security Report: Recent Developments and Forward Outlook

## 1. Overview

The security landscape in Sudan remains highly volatile [1, 2], marked by persistent conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) [1, 3], alongside other armed groups [1, 4, 5, 6, 7].

## 2. Key Security Events

### 2.1 Intensified Clashes and Drone Warfare
In North Darfur, El Fasher and its surrounding areas, including Zamzam Camp and Abu Shouk camp, have been sites of persistent and severe fighting [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].

### 2.2 Political Developments
The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have engaged in political maneuvering, forming an alliance with the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North and other groups [17, 9]. This alliance aims to govern areas under RSF control, primarily in Darfur [17].

### 2.3 Impact on United Nations Humanitarian Operations
The ongoing conflict has severely impacted humanitarian efforts and civilian populations, exacerbating an already dire situation [18, 19, 7, 20]. A World Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) aid convoy near Al Koma, North Darfur, was attacked [21]. This attack resulted in the deaths of five members, injuries to several others, and the burning of multiple trucks [21, 22].

## 3. Forward Outlook
### Armed Conflict Probability Forecast (Conflict Forecast)

According to [ConflictForecast](https://conflictforecast.org/), the predicted probability of armed conflict in Sudan in the next 3 months is of 99.61%.

*This prediction represents the risk that a country suffers an outbreak of armed conflict within the next three months, i.e. that the country goes from no fatalities to over 0.5 fatalities per one million inhabitants within a time horizon of three months.*

The following chart displays the armed conflict risk trend since 2020 until the present day:

### Subnational Perspective

An analysis of the data available as of July 2025 indicates that information regarding the classification of subnational ADM1 regions as hotspots, including the criteria for such classification (e.g., an expected increase of at least 25% in violent events), could not be verified [23]. Similarly, specific statistical data for the following regions—Central Darfur, Blue Nile, Northern, Aj Jazirah, River Nile, Khartoum, Sennar, West Darfur, and Gedaref—pertaining to average violent events over the last three months, predicted short-term violent events, and percentage increases, was not verifiable due to insufficient information [23].

#### Predicted Increase in Violent Events in the Short Term (ACLED)

[ACLED CAST](https://acleddata.com/conflict-alert-system/) predicts 9 ADM1 regions in Sudan to be hotspots for violent events in the next calendar month (August, 2025).

*An ADM1 region is considered to be a hotspot if the predicted increase in the number of violent events in the next month compared to the 3-month average is at least of 25%.*

The chart below shows regions with a predicted change in violent events.

Considering the hotspot criteria, the following regions are expected to have a significant increase in violent events in August, 2025:

| Region | Avg. # Violent Events (3 months) | Forecasted # Violent Events | % Increase |
|---|---|---|---|
| Central Darfur | 5 | 7 | 40.0% |
| Blue Nile | 1 | 5 | 400.0% |
| Northern | 7 | 9 | 28.6% |
| Aj Jazirah | 7 | 12 | 71.4% |
| River Nile | 2 | 6 | 200.0% |
| Khartoum | 33 | 49 | 48.5% |
| Sennar | 2 | 4 | 100.0% |
| West Darfur | 2 | 4 | 100.0% |
| Gedaref | 0 | 3 | 30.0% |
