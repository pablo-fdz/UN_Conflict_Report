Sudan Security Report: Recent Developments and Forward Outlook

## 1. Overview

The security landscape in Sudan remains highly volatile [1], [2], [3], marked by persistent conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) [3], alongside other armed groups [4], [5], [6].

## 2. Key Security Events

### 2.1 Intensified Clashes and Drone Warfare
In North Darfur, El Fasher and its surrounding areas have been sites of persistent and severe fighting [7, 8, 9, 3, 10]. Specifically, Zamzam Camp [11] and Abu Shouk camp [12] have also experienced severe clashes.

### 2.2 Political Developments
The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have engaged in political maneuvering, forming an alliance with the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) [13] and other groups, including various militias [14]. This alliance aims to govern areas under RSF control, primarily within Darfur [13].

### 2.3 Impact on United Nations Humanitarian Operations
The ongoing conflict has severely impacted humanitarian operations, leading to significant restrictions on aid delivery [15], and has had a severe impact on civilian populations [16, 17]. A notable incident involved an attack on a World Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) aid convoy near Al Koma, North Darfur [18]. This attack resulted in the deaths of five members [19, 21], injuries to several others [20, 21], and the burning of multiple trucks [20, 21].

## 3. Forward Outlook
### Armed Conflict Probability Forecast (Conflict Forecast)

According to [ConflictForecast](https://conflictforecast.org/), the predicted probability of armed conflict in Sudan in the next 3 months is of 99.61%.

*This prediction represents the risk that a country suffers an outbreak of armed conflict within the next three months, i.e. that the country goes from no fatalities to over 0.5 fatalities per one million inhabitants within a time horizon of three months.*

The following chart displays the armed conflict risk trend since 2020 until the present day:

### Subnational Perspective
Nine subnational ADM1 regions are classified as hotspots [22]. The identified hotspots exhibit an an expected increase of at least 25% in violent events in the short term [22].

#### Predicted Increase in Violent Events in the Short Term (ACLED)

[ACLED CAST](https://acleddata.com/conflict-alert-system/) predicts 9 ADM1 regions in Sudan to be hotspots for violent events in the next calendar month (August, 2025).

*An ADM1 region is considered to be a hotspot if the predicted increase in the number of violent events in the next month compared to the 3-month average is at least of 25%.*

The chart below shows regions with a predicted change in violent events.
