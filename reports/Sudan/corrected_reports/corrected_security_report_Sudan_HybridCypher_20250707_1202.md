Sudan Security Report: Recent Developments and Forward Outlook

## 1. Overview

Sudan continues to face a complex and volatile security landscape [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The ongoing conflict is primarily characterized by hostilities between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) [8], though other groups such as the Sudan Founding Alliance and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (North) (Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction) are also involved [8]. Recent events, predominantly occurring between April and June 2025, highlight intensified hostilities across multiple states [3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The conflict has had significant impacts on civilian populations [2, 6, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], leading to casualties [17, 18, 19] and large-scale displacement, with hundreds of thousands potentially displaced to Tawila [22, 23]. Furthermore, disruptions to essential services, including electricity grids and healthcare facilities, have been reported [7, 16, 24, 25], alongside disruptions to humanitarian operations [15, 17, 26, 27], underscoring a persistent state of instability across the country [4, 12, 24, 28, 29].

## 2. Key Security Events

The conflict has been characterized by continued intense fighting and shifts in territorial control [2, 30, 3, 31]. North Darfur, specifically the area around El Fasher and its adjacent displacement camps, including Zamzam and Abu Shouk, continues to be a significant flashpoint [32, 33]. Continuous clashes between Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary and government forces were reported in Zamzam Camp on April 12, 2025 [33]. Fighting persisted in various parts of El Fasher on April 23, 2025 [4], following new clashes between the RSF and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) reported in the city's northeast on April 17, 2025 [9]. RSF forces shelled Abu Shouk camp, as well as the Al-Quba and Al-Nasr neighborhoods of El Fasher, on April 23, 2025 [5]. On April 11, 2025, the RSF initiated new strikes in El Fasher, which prompted a response from the SAF [2, 34]. These RSF shelling incidents reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least 20 individuals in the city [34]. On April 13, 2025, the Sudan Liberation Movement, a rebel group, appealed to the SAF for assistance in El Fasher, citing ongoing paramilitary bombing that affected nearby displacement camps [23]. The RSF claimed control over Zamzam camp, located south of El Fasher, on April 13, 2025, amidst reports of clashes and significant displacement in the area [35].

In Khartoum State, the SAF claimed to have fully recaptured the state from the RSF on May 20, 2025, although fighting continued to be reported in Omdurman [3, 3].

Drone attacks have emerged as a significant aspect of recent hostilities. In River Nile State, Sudanese media reported a drone attack on Atbara on May 11, 2025 [36]. Earlier, on April 25, 2025, a drone attack in Atbara targeted a camp for displaced persons and reportedly struck the city's power station, leading to power outages in both River Nile and Red Sea States [7, 37]. In White Nile State, the RSF conducted a drone strike on an SAF command in Kosti on April 29, 2025 [38]. Two days prior, on April 27, 2025, the RSF also launched drone strikes against Sudanese military positions in the Arshkool area [39]. Additionally, explosions near oil depots in Kosti were reported on May 8, 2025 [40]. The RSF also captured the town of Al-Khawi in South Kordofan province on May 3, 2025, prompting rival SAF forces to retreat towards El Obeid [41]. In Northern State, renewed roadblocking by protesters in Wadi Halfa was reported on June 4, 2025, accompanied by threats of escalation, including the disruption of mining operations [12].

### Political and Strategic Developments
A notable political development occurred on July 1, 2025, when the RSF formed a political alliance with the Sudan Peopleâ€™s Liberation Movement-North and other factions [29]. This alliance's stated objective is to govern areas under RSF control, primarily within Darfur [29]. This action suggests a strategic shift by the RSF towards establishing administrative authority in contested regions.

### Impact on Civilians and Humanitarian Operations
The conflict continues to impose severe humanitarian consequences. On June 5, 2025, an RSF attack on a camp in El Fasher resulted in at least 14 fatalities and numerous injuries [42]. Civilian populations in conflict zones, particularly El Fasher, have been subjected to shelling and attacks on displacement camps [34, 23, 43, 44].

Humanitarian operations have also been directly impacted. On June 3, 2025, a joint World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF aid convoy, transporting life-saving supplies, was attacked near Al Koma, North Darfur [27]. The incident resulted in the deaths of five convoy members, injuries to several others, and the burning of multiple trucks [27, 15]. This event underscores the extreme hazards faced by humanitarian personnel delivering aid in Sudan.

## 3. Forward Outlook

### Subnational PerspectiveThe security situation in Sudan is expected to remain highly dynamic, with ongoing military confrontations and evolving political alignments shaping the future. The subnational perspective reveals distinct challenges and vulnerabilities across different states.#### Predicted Violent Events (ACLED)An ADM1 region is considered to be a hotspot if the predicted increase in the number of violent events in the next month compared to the 3-month average is at least of 25% [45].#### KhartoumThe capital region continues to be a focal point of control and contestation. The Government of Sudan implemented security measures, such as night curfews and prohibitions on public gatherings, on June 27, 2025 [12]. The army claimed to have fully recaptured Khartoum State on May 20, 2025 [3], although reports of continued fighting in Omdurman on the same day suggested the claim might not have been entirely accurate [3, 19, 46, 47]. These persistent clashes pose a risk to civilian safety and normal life.#### NorthernThe Northern state faces potential for continued civil unrest and disruption of economic activities. Protesters engaged in roadblocking in Wadi Halfa on June 4, 2025 [12], with threats of escalation, including the disruption of mining operations [12]. Such actions could lead to further economic strain and localized security incidents.#### River NileThis state remains highly vulnerable to drone attacks, as demonstrated by incidents in Atbara on April 25 [37] and May 11, 2025 [36]. These attacks have targeted both displaced persons' camps [7] and critical infrastructure like power stations [7], leading to widespread power outages in River Nile [37, 7] and Red Sea States [24]. The continued use of drones poses a significant threat to civilian safety and essential services, potentially exacerbating humanitarian needs.#### SennarNo specific security events were reported in the provided context for this region.#### West DarfurWhile specific events for West Darfur are not detailed in the provided text chunks, the broader Darfur region remains a primary conflict zone. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) formed a political alliance on July 1, 2025, to govern areas under its control, primarily in Darfur [29], suggesting a complex and evolving governance landscape alongside ongoing hostilities. This indicates continued instability and humanitarian challenges across the Darfur states.#### Central DarfurThe region has experienced violence against civilians. The broader Darfur conflict, including the RSF's political ambitions to govern areas under its control [29], indicates continued instability and humanitarian challenges.#### Blue NileThe Blue Nile region has experienced clashes between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF. SAF operations to retake control of areas like Baldago and surrounding parts of Maban county [48] suggest ongoing military engagements and a contested security environment.#### Aj JazirahAn accidental ordnance explosion has been reported in Aj Jazirah [49], indicating residual dangers from conflict or potential for isolated incidents.#### GedarefNo specific security events were reported in the provided context for this region.
