# Sudan Security Report

## Executive Summary

Sudan is currently experiencing a severe and protracted security crisis, marked by a two-year civil war primarily between the Sudanese army/government and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Recent events, particularly over the last year, indicate a significant escalation in conflict, targeting of critical infrastructure, and a deepening humanitarian crisis. The conflict has led to widespread instability, economic disruption, and a dire public health situation. The forward-looking perspective suggests continued high risk and instability across the country.

## Recent Events and Impacts (Last Year)

### 1. Escalation of Conflict and Infrastructure Attacks

The conflict between the Sudanese army/government and the Rapid Support Force (RSF) has intensified, with a notable shift towards targeting critical infrastructure.

*   **Oil Infrastructure Attacks:**
    *   Large fires at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan were reported, following RSF paramilitary drone strikes, which were the first of the country's two-year civil war [Editor's note: Owen].
    *   Sudanese civil defense later confirmed that all fires at major oil depots in government-controlled Port Sudan were "completely" under control following numerous RSF attacks on petroleum reserves [Sudanese civil defense].
    *   RSF drone strikes have specifically impacted pump stations, depots, and port facilities on the Red Sea [Editor's note: Sarah].
    *   The Sudanese government has drafted contingency plans to suspend the import and export of oil from South Sudan in the event of further RSF strikes to destabilize the oil transit system, describing the risk as high [Editor's note: Sarah, Radio Tamazuj].
*   **Drone Strikes and Energy Infrastructure:**
    *   New drone strikes were reported on unspecified areas in Port Sudan by Sudanese media [Sudanese media].
    *   An RSF drone struck an ammunition depot in Port Sudan [unnamed military source, Sudanese government, RSF].
    *   Long-range RSF drone strikes have targeted power stations, including in Omdurman, leading to a total power outage in Port Sudan and widespread power cuts in Khartoum and Wadi Halfa [RSF, Sudanese electric utility company].
    *   Drone strikes were also reported in White Nile state (Atbara, Kosti), Al-Khawi, Omdurman, Khor Delib, and Al Koma [kg_rels].
    *   The Sudanese government has engaged in drone interception and anti-aircraft fire against RSF drones [Sudanese government, anti-aircraft networks].
*   **Airport and Port Disruptions:**

    *   Fighting has been reported in En Nahud, Khartoum State (including the Battle for control), Omdurman, Nyala, and Al-Khawi [kg_rels].
    *   RSF forces captured En Nahud, engaging in looting, attacking public buildings, and killing civilians [RSF forces].
    *   The RSF also carried out a prison capture and inmate release in En Nahud [RSF forces].
    *   A Sudan army official reported the discovery of 465 bodies and the liberation of hundreds of captives [Sudan army official].

    *   The burning of eight villages was attributed to an unnamed military source [unnamed military source].
*   **Humanitarian and Health Crisis:**
    *   A cholera outbreak was reported in Khartoum and North Kordofan, with the health ministry reporting 727 cases and 12 deaths [health ministry, officials].
    *   2.9 million doses of oral vaccine against cholera arrived in Port Sudan [WHO].
    *   The country has also been affected by heavy rain, impacting 1,000 others and four others [Impact of Heavy Rain].
    *   Assessment of refugee conditions and evacuations have been undertaken [Sudanese government].

### 3. Political and Regional Dynamics

The internal conflict is intertwined with broader political and regional developments.

*   **South Sudan Instability:** South Sudan's president announced a sweeping reshuffle of key state government positions in Upper Nile, Central Equatoria, and Warrap states amid increasing political instability [South Sudan's president].
*   **International Relations:**
    *   The US is set to impose sanctions on Sudan [US].
    *   Sudan has accused the UAE of violating international conventions, with reports of UAE ships cooperating with the RSF [Sudan, UAE, Emirati].
    *   The Sudanese government has formed a militia [Sudanese government].
    *   A government dissolution and oath-taking by secretaries of ministries occurred under Kamil Idriss [Kamil Idriss].

## Actors Involved

*   **Primary Combatants:**
    *   **Sudanese Army (Army/Sudanese Government):** Engaged in conflict with RSF, conducting airstrikes, drone interceptions, and military operations to regain control of areas like Khartoum State and Al-Khawi.
    *   **Rapid Support Force (RSF/RSF paramilitary/RSF militants):** The primary aggressor, conducting drone strikes, attacks on critical infrastructure (oil depots, power stations, airports), civilian areas, and hospitals. Responsible for looting and killing civilians.
*   **Supporting/Affected Entities:**
    *   **Sudanese Civil Defense:** Involved in controlling fires at oil depots.
    *   **Sudanese Media:** Reporting on events, including drone strikes.
    *   **South Sudan:** Affected by potential oil transit disruptions.
    *   **United States (US):** Imposing sanctions on Sudan.
    *   **United Arab Emirates (UAE):** Accused by Sudan of violating international conventions and cooperating with the RSF.
    *   **Health Ministry/Officials:** Reporting on cholera outbreaks and managing public health responses.
    *   **WHO, UNICEF, WFP:** Involved in humanitarian aid and vaccine delivery, and affected by attacks on aid convoys.
    *   **Civilians:** Directly impacted by violence, displacement, and health crises.

## Forward-Looking Perspective

Sudan's stability remains highly precarious. The ongoing two-year civil war, characterized by the RSF's continued targeting of vital infrastructure and civilian areas, suggests a prolonged period of conflict and instability. The Sudanese government's contingency plans for oil export suspension underscore the high risk to the country's economic lifelines. The humanitarian situation, exacerbated by disease outbreaks and challenges to aid delivery, is likely to worsen without a significant de-escalation of hostilities. Regional political instability, as seen in South Sudan, and international pressures, such as US sanctions and accusations against the UAE, further complicate the path to peace and recovery. The current trajectory indicates continued conflict, economic strain, and severe humanitarian challenges in the foreseeable future.
