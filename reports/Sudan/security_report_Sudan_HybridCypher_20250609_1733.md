## Sudan Security Report: A Year of Escalating Conflict and Humanitarian Crisis

**Introduction:**
The past year in Sudan has been dominated by the devastating civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), marking a period of intense conflict, widespread destruction, and a deepening humanitarian catastrophe. Events on the ground indicate a protracted struggle with severe consequences for the civilian population and the country's future.

**Key Events (Last Year):**

*   **Intensified Conflict and RSF Expansion:**
    *   **Unprecedented Attacks on Port Sudan:** The RSF significantly escalated its tactics by launching the first-ever drone strikes on Port Sudan, a critical government stronghold and economic hub. These attacks targeted vital infrastructure, including multiple oil depots, an air base (Osman Digna Air Base), a cargo warehouse, the airport, and power stations [1, 3, 4, 6]. These strikes resulted in large fires, power outages, and significant damage to energy infrastructure, highlighting the RSF's expanding operational reach [1, 3, 6].
    *   **Western Front Engagements:** In North Kordofan, RSF forces attempted to seize control of key areas like Nahud. While Sudanese army defenses reportedly held in Nahud, the RSF successfully captured the prison in En Nahud, leading to widespread looting, attacks on public buildings, and the release of inmates [2, 6].
    *   **Targeting of Civilian Infrastructure and Hospitals:** The conflict saw a disturbing trend of attacks on civilian facilities. RSF forces were implicated in shelling and strikes on hospitals, including El Obeid Hospital, Social Security Hospital, and an MSF hospital in Old Fangak, severely impacting healthcare access for civilians [6].

*   **Sudanese Army Counter-Offensives:**
    *   **Reclaiming Territory:** The SAF launched operations to regain control in contested areas, notably recapturing parts of Khartoum State and Al-Khawi in North Kordofan [7]. These efforts often involved intense fighting and military operations to clear areas [7].
    *   **Air Defense Operations:** The SAF actively engaged RSF drones, with anti-aircraft defenses reported at work in Port Sudan and other locations, intercepting incoming threats [4, 7].
    *   **Airstrikes:** The Sudanese army conducted airstrikes targeting RSF positions and stockpiles, including at Nyala Airport, in an attempt to degrade RSF capabilities [7].

*   **Deepening Humanitarian Crisis:**
    *   **Disease Outbreaks:** The conflict exacerbated public health crises, with a significant cholera outbreak reported in Khartoum and North Kordofan, leading to hundreds of cases and dozens of deaths [8]. The arrival of oral cholera vaccine doses in Port Sudan underscored the severity of the situation [6].
    *   **Aid Obstruction and Displacement:** Attacks on aid convoys, including those from UNICEF and WFP, severely hampered humanitarian relief efforts [8]. The ongoing violence led to massive internal displacement and a growing refugee crisis, with assessments of refugee conditions being undertaken [8].
    *   **Civilian Casualties:** Reports indicated continued killing of civilians and inter-communal violence in various regions [6, 8].

*   **External Dynamics and Political Instability:**
    *   **External Accusations:** Sudan accused the UAE of violating international conventions, implying external support for the RSF [9].
    *   **International Sanctions:** The US moved to impose sanctions on Sudan in response to the escalating conflict [9].
    *   **Internal Political Shifts:** The country experienced political changes, including a government dissolution and sweeping reshuffles of key state government positions [9].

**Forward-Looking Perspective:**

The security situation in Sudan remains highly volatile and deeply concerning. The past year's events indicate a trajectory towards:

*   **Protracted Conflict:** With both the SAF and RSF demonstrating capabilities to sustain operations and target critical infrastructure, a swift resolution to the civil war appears unlikely. This suggests continued violence, further civilian casualties, and widespread instability.
*   **Economic Collapse and Infrastructure Degradation:** The targeting of oil depots, power stations, and transport hubs will further cripple Sudan's already fragile economy. Continued destruction of infrastructure will impede recovery efforts and deepen the humanitarian crisis, potentially leading to a complete breakdown of essential services.
*   **Worsening Humanitarian Catastrophe:** The scale of displacement, food insecurity, and disease outbreaks (like cholera) is projected to worsen significantly without a sustained cessation of hostilities and unimpeded humanitarian access. The healthcare system is on the brink of collapse.
*   **Regional Destabilization:** The conflict's spillover effects, including large-scale refugee flows into neighboring countries and the potential for regional proxy conflicts, pose a significant threat to broader Horn of Africa stability.
*   **Uncertain Political Future:** The absence of a clear political pathway to peace, coupled with ongoing internal power struggles and external influences, leaves Sudan's governance and future highly uncertain.

In conclusion, Sudan faces an extremely challenging future, with the ongoing conflict threatening to unravel the country's social fabric and economic viability. A concerted international effort for de-escalation, humanitarian access, and a political resolution is critically needed to avert further catastrophe.
