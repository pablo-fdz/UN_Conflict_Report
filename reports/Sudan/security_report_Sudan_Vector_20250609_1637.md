# Sudan Security Report: Last Year & Forward Look

## Overview

Sudan has endured a devastating civil conflict over the past year, primarily between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict has seen a significant escalation in hostilities, marked by the expansion of combat zones and the increasing use of drone warfare, impacting both military and civilian infrastructure.

## Key Events (Last Year)

The past year has been characterized by several critical security incidents, demonstrating the evolving nature and reach of the conflict:

*   **Targeting of Port Sudan:** A notable development has been the RSF's increasing focus on Port Sudan, a vital Red Sea port and a key government stronghold.
    *   Multiple drone attacks have been reported, targeting **civilian facilities, an air base, and a cargo warehouse** (Source 1).
    *   Further drone attacks on the city were reported, with air defense systems actively engaged (Source 2).
    *   Significantly, a series of **RSF paramilitary drone strikes** on Port Sudan were linked to large fires at **multiple oil depots**, marking the first such strikes in the city since the civil war began (Source 4). This indicates a strategic shift towards disrupting critical economic and logistical infrastructure.
*   **Attacks on Civilian and Educational Infrastructure:** The conflict has continued to impact civilian areas and institutions.
    *   The **University of Khartoum in Omdurman** was reportedly targeted by the Rapid Support Forces with explosive drones (Source 5), highlighting the devastating impact on education and urban centers.

## Analysis and Impact

These events underscore several critical trends:

*   **Geographical Expansion:** The targeting of Port Sudan, previously considered relatively safe, signifies the conflict's expansion beyond traditional battlegrounds in Khartoum, Omdurman, and Darfur. This threatens vital supply lines and humanitarian access.
*   **Evolving Tactics:** The widespread and strategic use of drones by the RSF demonstrates an adaptation in warfare tactics, allowing for precision strikes on critical infrastructure and military assets from a distance.
*   **Humanitarian Crisis:** The continued targeting of civilian facilities and urban centers exacerbates the already dire humanitarian situation, displacing millions and destroying essential services.

## Forward-Looking Perspective

The trajectory of the conflict suggests a challenging future for Sudan:

*   **Protracted Conflict:** The strategic targeting of key infrastructure and the continued use of advanced weaponry indicate that both sides are committed to a prolonged struggle, making a swift resolution unlikely.
*   **Increased Instability:** The expansion of the conflict to strategic locations like Port Sudan could further destabilize the entire region, impacting trade routes and potentially drawing in external actors.
*   **Humanitarian Catastrophe:** Without a significant de-escalation, the humanitarian crisis is set to worsen, with increased displacement, food insecurity, and a collapse of public services.
*   **Challenges to Governance:** The ongoing conflict severely undermines any efforts to establish a stable transitional government, prolonging political uncertainty and hindering post-conflict recovery.
*   **Risk of Regional Spillover:** While not directly related to the internal Sudanese conflict, regional instability (e.g., in neighboring South Sudan, Source 3) could indirectly impact Sudan's security landscape through refugee flows or cross-border dynamics, though the primary threat remains internal.

The immediate future for Sudan appears to be one of continued conflict, with significant risks to civilian populations and critical infrastructure, demanding urgent international attention and concerted efforts towards a political resolution.

3.  Editor's note: A Twitter/X account claiming to represent the South Sudanese ethnic Nuer militant group Naath Defense Forces said that the government of South Sudan launched airstrikes on Nuer civilian areas in Old Fangak and nearby villages beginning early this morning. We have not yet seen reports surface in local media. We are monitoring for further information. - Theresa
4.  Editor's note: We are aware of images circulating on social media of a large fire burning at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan, Sudan. The attack has not yet been reported on by Sudanese media, and the cause of the fires is still unclear. The fires come just one day after a series of RSF paramilitary drone strikes in the city, which were the first of the country's two year civil war. We are watching our sources for more information. - Owen
