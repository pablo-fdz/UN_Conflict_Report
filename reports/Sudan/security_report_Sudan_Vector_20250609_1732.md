**Brief Security Report: Sudan (Last Year)**

**Introduction:**
The past year in Sudan has been dominated by the devastating civil conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). While the conflict's initial epicenters were Khartoum and Darfur, recent events indicate a significant and concerning expansion of hostilities, particularly impacting critical logistical and governmental hubs.

**Key Events (Last Year):**

The most prominent security events in the last year highlight a strategic shift in the conflict, with Port Sudan emerging as a key target:

*   **Drone Attacks on Port Sudan:** Multiple drone attacks have been reported targeting Port Sudan, a vital Red Sea port that serves as the de facto seat of the Sudanese government and a crucial entry point for humanitarian aid.
    *   One reported incident involved a drone attack on Port Sudan that targeted "civilian facilities including air base and a cargo warehouse," with unverified reports of associated power outages in parts of the city. (Source 1)
    *   Subsequent reports from Sudanese media confirmed new drone attacks on unspecified areas within Port Sudan, noting that air defense systems were actively engaged. (Source 2, Source 4)
    *   A particularly impactful event involved "a large fire burning at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan." This incident occurred shortly after "a series of RSF paramilitary drone strikes in the city," which were described as the first such strikes in the country's two-year civil war, suggesting the RSF's increasing reach and targeting capabilities. (Source 3)

**Analysis and Implications:**

These events signify a critical escalation and geographical expansion of the conflict. The repeated targeting of Port Sudan, a strategic military, economic, and humanitarian hub, indicates a deliberate effort to disrupt government operations, cripple supply lines, and undermine the country's economic lifeline. The reported involvement of RSF paramilitary drone strikes suggests a calculated strategy to exert pressure on the SAF and destabilize areas previously considered relatively secure. Attacks on civilian facilities and critical infrastructure like oil depots have severe humanitarian and economic consequences, exacerbating an already dire situation for the Sudanese population.

**Forward-Looking Perspective:**

The trajectory of events in the last year suggests that the conflict in Sudan is likely to remain protracted and volatile. The expansion of hostilities to strategic locations like Port Sudan indicates a continued struggle for control over vital infrastructure and resources. This will likely lead to:

*   **Worsening Humanitarian Crisis:** Continued violence and disruption of supply chains will further exacerbate food insecurity, mass displacement, and limited access to essential services for millions of Sudanese.
*   **Economic Deterioration:** Attacks on economic assets and trade routes will further cripple an already fragile economy, hindering any prospects for recovery and development.
*   **Regional Instability:** The prolonged conflict risks further regional spillover, impacting neighboring countries through increased refugee flows, cross-border illicit activities, and potential destabilization.
*   **Elusive Political Resolution:** Without significant international pressure and a genuine commitment from the warring parties to de-escalate and negotiate, a lasting political settlement remains distant, prolonging the suffering and instability across the nation.

The future of Sudan hinges on the ability of internal and external actors to de-escalate the conflict, protect civilians, and foster a credible path towards a comprehensive political resolution.
