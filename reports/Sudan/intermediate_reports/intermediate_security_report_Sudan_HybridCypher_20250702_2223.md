# Sudan Security Report: Escalating Conflict and Regional Instability


## 1. Overview
The security situation in Sudan remains highly volatile [1, 2, 3, 4], marked by intense conflict between the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) [5]. This conflict has generated significant instability across key regions, including Khartoum State, Darfur, and critical infrastructure in Port Sudan [1, 6]. The ongoing hostilities have resulted in civilian casualties [7], widespread disruption [8], and impacts on essential services [2]. While these internal instabilities are profound, direct confirmation of their impact on the stability of neighboring regions is not fully established. Separately, political instability is evident in neighboring South Sudan [3], highlighted by a recent government reshuffle of key state government positions in Upper Nile, Central Equatoria, and Warrap states [2].

[3] Editor's note: Local media is reporting that the Sudanese government has drafted contingency plans to suspend the import and export of oil from South Sudan in the event of further RSF strikes to destabilize the oil transit system. Recent drone strikes have impacted pump stations, depots and port facilities on the Red Sea. Radio Tamazuj is reporting that a letter, dated Friday, showed the Sudanese government warning South Sudan that they would be unable to facilitate the export of South Sudanese oil from Port Sudan if the transportation system was further compromised. They describe the risk as high, and the contingency plans as "fast track." We will keep an eye out for any reports of further disruption along key exchange routes. -Sarah

## 2. Key Security Events
### Intensified Fighting in Khartoum and Omdurman The Sudan army has initiated a "large-scale operation" with the objective of reclaiming all of Khartoum State from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) [1]. Despite this operation, fighting persists, particularly in the southern and western areas of Omdurman [1]. Reports indicate explosions and clashes in Omdurman as the army continues its efforts to dislodge the RSF from their remaining positions [2, 1]. Furthermore, the University of Khartoum in Omdurman has been targeted by RSF explosive drones [3]. ### Drone Attacks and Infrastructure Threats in Port Sudan Port Sudan has experienced a series of RSF paramilitary drone attacks, which led to the suspension of all flights at its airport [4]. While a pro-government Sudanese media outlet alleged that RSF drone attacks caused fires at oil depots in Port Sudan, the precise cause of these fires remains unclear [5]. The Sudanese civil defense has since brought these fires under complete control [6]. Additional drone strikes have been reported in unspecified areas of Port Sudan, with air defense systems reportedly active [7, 8]. A drone attack reportedly targeted a naval base in Port Sudan, preceded by reports of smoke and anti-aircraft fire [9, 7]. The Sudanese military stated that a drone attack on Port Sudan targeted civilian facilities, including an air base and a cargo warehouse, with unverified reports of power outages in parts of the city [10]. A five-drone attack on Port Sudan International Airport was also reported [11]. In response to these threats, the Sudanese government has developed contingency plans to suspend the import and export of oil from South Sudan if the oil transit system, which includes pump stations, depots, and Red Sea port facilities, is further compromised by RSF strikes [12, 13]. ### Conflict in Darfur and Other Regions Army airstrikes have targeted Rapid Support Force positions in Nyala, Darfur [14]. Near El Fasher, North Darfur, RSF drone attacks resulted in seven fatalities, and drone and artillery attacks caused 15 injuries, as the conflict for control of the region continues [15, 16]. A drone attack was reported on Atbara in River Nile state [7]. The Sudan People's Liberation Movement–North (SPLM-N) has accused the military of burning eight villages in the Heiban area of South Kordofan in early May [17]. Additionally, three Sudanese armed groups have formed a militia to secure the Um Gargour eastern border area with Eritrea [18]. ### United Nations Humanitarian Operations The World Health Organization (WHO) facilitated the delivery of 2.9 million doses of oral cholera vaccine to Port Sudan [19]. Aid convoys from UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP) have also come under attack [20, 21].

## 3. Forward Outlook
### Armed Conflict Probability Forecast (Conflict Forecast)

According to ConflictForecast, the predicted probability of armed conflict in Sudan in the next three months is 99.61% [1]. This prediction assesses the risk of a country experiencing an outbreak of armed conflict within a three-month horizon, defined as a transition from no fatalities to over 0.5 fatalities per one million inhabitants [1].

### Subnational Perspective

Based on data available in July 2025, nine ADM1 regions are predicted to be conflict hotspots, indicating an expected increase of at least 25% in violent events in the short term [2].

#### Predicted Increase in Violent Events in the Short Term (ACLED)

ACLED CAST predicts nine ADM1 regions in Sudan will be hotspots for violent events in the upcoming calendar month (August 2025) [2]. An ADM1 region is classified as a hotspot if the predicted increase in the number of violent events in the next month, compared to the three-month average, is at least 25% [2].
