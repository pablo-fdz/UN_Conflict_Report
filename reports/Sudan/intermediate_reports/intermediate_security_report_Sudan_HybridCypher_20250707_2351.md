## 1. Overview

Sudan has been engulfed in a devastating civil war since fighting erupted on April 15, 2023, between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) [1, 2]. This conflict shattered a period of peace following recent coups and two prior civil wars, severely worsening an already precarious humanitarian situation [1]. As of July 2, 2025, the conflict has been ongoing for over two years [2], leading to an estimated 150,000 deaths [3], displacing nearly 10 million people [4], and pushing more than 24 million to crisis levels of hunger [1, 3]. The World Food Program (WFP) has characterized the situation as "the world’s worst humanitarian crisis" [3]. The conflict stems from a power struggle between SAF leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti) [2]. They were initially allies in the 2019 overthrow of dictator Omar al-Bashir [4] and the subsequent 2021 coup that toppled Sudan’s interim government [1]. Hemedti's violent revolt in mid-April 2023 was triggered by Burhan's push to integrate the RSF into the national army [1]. The RSF, originally created by Omar al-Bashir as a border force, has historically been involved in violent operations, with its precursor, the Janjaweed, implicated in atrocities in Darfur since 2003 [3]. The RSF reportedly funds its operations largely through gold mines, with most of the gold sold to the Emirates [3]. International efforts to mediate peace, including negotiations led by the United States and Saudi Arabia, have resulted in over a dozen failed ceasefires [1]. Peace plans proposed by the African Union and other regional blocs have also been unsuccessful [1, 4]. An Egypt-led conference in July 2023 established humanitarian corridors and a framework for political dialogue, but failed to resolve the conflict [1]. The Sudanese government suspended its membership in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) due to its outreach to Hemedti [1] and has restricted media access within Sudan [1]. Currently, negotiations remain at a standstill due to a lack of political will from both sides [1].

## 2. Key Security Events

Recent security events highlight the ongoing intensity and widespread impact of the conflict across Sudan:

### Military Engagements and Territorial Control
*   On April 10, 2025, clashes occurred between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and Shugara-Berti forces in Umm Keddada, North Darfur [1]. The RSF initially gained control of the area [2], but Shugara forces later recaptured it [1]. These clashes resulted in many civilian fatalities, with an unspecified number recorded as 10 [1]. Additionally, 3,500 households were displaced [1]. Reports also indicated that RSF forces looted civilians [3] and Starlink networks [1].
*   On April 15, 2025, clashes between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF continued in Al Sufayra (Um Bada), Khartoum [4]. The SAF regained control of the village [5], and 3 fatalities were recorded for this event [4].
*   On April 18, 2025, the Sudanese military reported successfully thwarting an attack by RSF paramilitaries attempting to advance into northern El Fasher, North Darfur [6].
*   On April 23, 2025, fighting persisted between Sudan's warring military factions in multiple areas of El Fasher, North Darfur [7]. On the same day, RSF militia forces shelled the Abu Shouk camp in El Fasher [8].
*   On April 27, 2025, the RSF launched drone strikes targeting a Sudanese military position in the Arshkool area, White Nile [9].
*   On April 29, 2025, the RSF conducted another drone strike, targeting the army command in the town of Kosti [10].
*   On May 11, 2025, the Sudanese army carried out airstrikes against RSF positions in the Nyala area of South Darfur [11].
*   On May 19, 2025, clashes between SAF and RSF continued in Omdurman - Al Salha, Khartoum [12]. The SAF regained control of a significant portion of the neighborhood [12] and seized a large quantity of RSF weapons [12]. An unspecified number of fatalities, coded as 3, were recorded [12].
*   On May 20, 2025, fighting was still reported in Omdurman, Khartoum [13].
*   On May 23, 2025, clashes between SAF, supported by Darfur Joint Forces/JSAMF, and RSF continued in Dibebad, South Kordofan [14]. The SAF regained control of the area [15]. The Joint Forces claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on RSF personnel and equipment [16], with an unspecified number of RSF fatalities coded as 10 [17]. Reports indicated 1 SAF soldier was also killed [14], totaling 11 fatalities for the event [14]. This event also led to the displacement of 565 households [14].
*   On June 13, 2025, clashes between SAF and RSF continued in Bout, Blue Nile, with RSF artillery shelling reported [18]. No fatalities were recorded for this event [18].
*   On June 14, 2025, further clashes between SAF and RSF occurred in southwestern Bout, Blue Nile, resulting in an unspecified number of RSF fatalities [19].

### Civilian Impact and Governance
*   On May 1, 2025, the Governor renewed the state of emergency across River Nile state (Ad Damar) due to persistent insecurity in the region [20].
*   On June 28, 2025, a mine collapse in a desert area of River Nile state is feared to have killed at least 50 people [21]. Rescue efforts were reportedly delayed due to the remote location and poor road conditions [21].

### United Nations Humanitarian Operations
The ongoing conflict has exacerbated an already severe humanitarian crisis in Sudan. Before the civil war, an estimated 3.7 million people were internally displaced, and Sudan hosted 1.3 million refugees, primarily from South Sudan [22]. The current conflict has led to the displacement of more than 12 million people [22] and pushed over 24 million to crisis levels of hunger [22]. This situation has been described by the World Food Program (WFP) as the "world’s worst humanitarian crisis" [23]. Neighboring countries are now hosting over 4 million Sudanese refugees [24], raising concerns about broader regional destabilization [25]. Reports indicate widespread human rights abuses, including ethnic cleansing [26, 27], sexual violence [26], and mass killings [26], primarily carried out by the RSF, particularly in Darfur [26, 27].

## 3. Forward Outlook

The security outlook for Sudan remains highly volatile [1, 2, 3] and challenging [1, 3]. This is primarily due to the ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) [4, 5], a severe humanitarian crisis [1, 6], and stalled peace negotiations [1]. The deep trauma inflicted, particularly in regions like Darfur, makes reconciliation a formidable task [7], with many Sudanese finding forgiveness for RSF atrocities "almost impossible" [2].

### Subnational Perspective

#### Blue Nile
The Blue Nile state faces persistent insecurity and a high risk of further armed confrontations [8].

#### Gedaref
No specific recent security events or forward-looking information for Gedaref state were provided in the context.

#### Khartoum
Khartoum, the capital, has seen significant military activity, with the SAF regaining control of areas like Al Sufayra (Um Bada) on April 15, 2025 [9], and a large portion of Omdurman - Al Salha on May 19, 2025 [10]. While some areas in Khartoum have been liberated [11, 12], fighting continued in Omdurman after May 20, 2025 [13, 14]. Initial returns of displaced populations have occurred in liberated areas [2]. The outlook for Khartoum involves continued efforts to consolidate SAF control and manage the return of displaced persons, though residual pockets of resistance or sporadic clashes may persist.

#### Central Darfur
No specific recent security events or forward-looking information for Central Darfur state were provided in the context.

#### Northern
No specific recent security events or forward-looking information for Northern state were provided in the context.

#### Aj Jazirah
Some areas in Aj Jazirah have been liberated, leading to initial returns of displaced populations [2]. This suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook for stabilization and recovery in these specific areas, provided the broader conflict does not re-escalate significantly.

#### Sennar
No specific recent security events or forward-looking information for Sennar state were provided in the context.

#### West Darfur
West Darfur, particularly the broader Darfur region, remains a critical hotspot for violence [1, 15, 16, 17, 2] and human rights abuses [1]. SAF airstrikes targeted RSF positions in El Geneina on May 11, 2025 [18]. The Darfur region has been the epicenter of ethnic cleansing [2, 19], sexual violence [2, 1], and mass killings [2, 19] attributed to the RSF and its precursor, the Janjaweed, since 2003 [2, 1, 19]. The outlook for West Darfur is grim, with continued risk of ethnically-driven violence [19], displacement [5], and severe humanitarian needs [20].

#### River Nile
River Nile state faces ongoing insecurity [21, 22], leading to the renewal of a state of emergency by the Governor on May 1, 2025 [8]. A mine collapse on June 28, 2025, resulted in an estimated 50 fatalities [23, 24]. This incident highlights additional risks beyond direct conflict, such as industrial incidents exacerbated by poor infrastructure and remote locations.
