## 1. Overview

Sudan continues to experience a complex and volatile security situation [1], [2]. The ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is a significant factor contributing to this situation. This conflict has involved widespread fighting across multiple states, including North Darfur [3], [4], [5], White Nile [6], Blue Nile [7], [6], Khartoum [8], and Red Sea [9], [10]. Conflict activity, including a drone attack, has also been reported in River Nile state [11]. South Darfur has experienced substantial conflict activity, with reports of RSF paramilitary forces utilizing advanced foreign air defense systems in the region [12]. The landscape is further complicated by the involvement of other armed groups, such as the Sudan Founding Alliance (SFA), which includes elements of the RSF [8] and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N-Abdelaziz) [13]. Recent events indicate continued military engagements [1], [4], [14], including drone strikes [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] and ground clashes [1], [3], [4], [21]. These conflicts have resulted in significant humanitarian impacts on the civilian population [22], [23], [24], [25].

## 2. Key Security Events

### Intensified Clashes and Territorial Control
The conflict has been marked by persistent and often intense clashes across various regions. In North Darfur, persistent fighting has been reported in multiple parts of El Fasher [1], including ongoing clashes in Zamzam Camp between Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary and government forces [2]. The RSF has reportedly shelled civilian areas, specifically Abu Shouk camp [3], and the Al-Quba [3] and Al-Nasr neighborhoods of El Fasher [3]. The Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) has requested army assistance in El Fasher, citing continued paramilitary bombing that has impacted nearby displacement camps [4]. The RSF also asserted control over Zamzam camp amidst reports of clashes and significant displacement [2, 5]. Furthermore, an RSF militia attack on a camp in El Fasher resulted in at least 14 fatalities [6]. Earlier, the RSF initiated new strikes in El Fasher, to which the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) responded with artillery [7, 8].

Drone attacks have become a prominent feature of the conflict. In White Nile State, the RSF conducted drone strikes on Sudanese military positions in the Arshkool area [9, 10] and targeted the army command in Kosti [11]. Explosions near oil depots in Kosti were also reported [12]. The River Nile state also experienced a drone attack on Atbara [13]. In the Red Sea state, a large fire occurred at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan [14]. This incident followed a series of RSF paramilitary drone strikes in the city, which marked the first such attacks in Port Sudan during the civil war [14]. However, the direct cause of the fires remains unclear [14].

The SAF has made efforts to regain territorial control. In Blue Nile state, the SAF engaged in clashes with the Sudan Founding Alliance (SFA), a group associated with the RSF and SPLM-N-Abdelaziz, in Baldugu (Bau) [15, 16]. The SAF successfully regained control of this area [16], leading to the withdrawal of RSF elements to South Sudan [15]. In Khartoum, while military sources indicated that the army was close to recapturing all of Khartoum State from the RSF militia, fighting was still reported in Omdurman, suggesting the recapture was not yet complete [17]. Internal conflicts within the RSF were also observed, with two RSF factions clashing in Taiyba Al Nile market in Nyala, South Darfur, which resulted in numerous civilian injuries [18].

### United Nations Humanitarian Operations
The conflict has severely impacted humanitarian efforts. An aid convoy transporting life-saving supplies, jointly operated by the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF, was attacked near Al Koma in North Darfur [19]. This attack resulted in the deaths of five personnel, injuries to several others, and the burning of multiple trucks [19, 20]. This incident underscores the extreme dangers faced by humanitarian personnel and the significant challenges in delivering aid to affected populations.

### Political and Economic Developments
On the political front, the RSF formed a political alliance with the Sudan Peopleâ€™s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) and other groups [21]. This alliance aims to govern areas under its control, primarily in Darfur [21]. Economically, the security situation has caused significant disruptions. The Bank of Khartoum reopened its branch in Hasahisa, Al Jazirah state [22], following a suspension of several months due to insecurity [22]. However, in Northern state, renewed roadblocking by protesters in Wadi Halfa, accompanied by threats of escalating actions including the disruption of mining operations, indicates ongoing civil unrest and economic vulnerability [23].

## 3. Forward Outlook

### Subnational PerspectiveSeveral subnational ADM1 regions are identified as areas with projected increases in violent events in the short term. The specific forecasts for these regions are detailed below:#### Blue NileThe Blue Nile state is projected to experience a significant increase in violent events, with a predicted rise of 400% [1]. Recent events in the region include clashes between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Sudan Founding Alliance (SFA), which is associated with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and SPLM-N-Abdelaziz, in Baldugu (Bau) [2]. The SAF subsequently regained control of the area [3], leading to the withdrawal of RSF elements to South Sudan [10]. This indicates continued contestation for control and potential for further escalation.#### NorthernThe Northern state is forecast to see a 28.57% increase in violent events [4]. Recent reports from Wadi Halfa indicate renewed roadblocking by protesters [5], who have also threatened escalating actions, including the disruption of mining operations [5]. This suggests a growing potential for civil unrest to impact local stability and economic activities.#### KhartoumKhartoum is expected to experience a 48.48% increase in violent events [6]. While military sources reported the recapture of Khartoum State from the RSF by the army [6], fighting was still reported in Omdurman [6]. This indicates that despite claims of territorial gains, the capital region remains highly contested and prone to continued conflict.#### River NileThe River Nile state is forecasted to have a 200% increase in violent events [4]. A recent drone attack on Atbara has been reported [7], signaling that the conflict is extending to areas previously considered relatively stable, increasing the risk of further attacks and instability.#### Aj JazirahAj Jazirah is anticipated to see a 71.43% increase in violent events [4]. The reopening of the Bank of Khartoum's branch in Hasahisa [8] suggests some level of stabilization or return to normalcy in certain areas. However, the forecast indicates a strong potential for renewed insecurity, which could reverse these fragile gains.#### GedarefGedaref is predicted to have a 30% increase in violent events [4]. No specific recent events for Gedaref were mentioned in the provided context, but the forecast suggests an emerging risk of increased violence in the short term.#### Central DarfurCentral Darfur is expected to see a 40% increase in violent events [4]. No specific recent events for Central Darfur were mentioned in the provided context, indicating a potential for escalating conflict that may not yet be widely reported.#### SennarSennar is forecasted to have a 100% increase in violent events [4]. No specific recent events for Sennar were mentioned in the provided context, highlighting a significant anticipated deterioration in the security situation.#### West DarfurWest Darfur is predicted to have a 100% increase in violent events [9].
