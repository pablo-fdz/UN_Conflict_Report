## 2. Key Security Events

### 2.1 Intensified Clashes and Drone Warfare
In North Darfur, El Fasher and its surrounding areas have been sites of persistent and severe fighting [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Specifically, Zamzam Camp [6] and Abu Shouk camp [7] have also experienced severe clashes.

### 2.2 Political Developments
The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have engaged in political maneuvering, forming an alliance with the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) [8] and other groups, including various militias [9]. This alliance aims to govern areas under RSF control, primarily within Darfur [8].

### 2.3 Impact on United Nations Humanitarian Operations
The ongoing conflict has severely impacted humanitarian operations, leading to significant restrictions on aid delivery [10], and has had a severe impact on civilian populations [11, 12]. A notable incident involved an attack on a World Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) aid convoy near Al Koma, North Darfur [13]. This attack resulted in the deaths of five members [14, 16], injuries to several others [15, 16], and the burning of multiple trucks [15, 16].
