## 2. Key Security Events

### 2.1 Intensified Clashes and Drone Warfare
In North Darfur, El Fasher and its surrounding areas, including Zamzam Camp and Abu Shouk camp, have been sites of persistent and severe fighting [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

### 2.2 Political Developments
The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have engaged in political maneuvering, forming an alliance with the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North and other groups [10, 2]. This alliance aims to govern areas under RSF control, primarily in Darfur [10].

### 2.3 Impact on United Nations Humanitarian Operations
The ongoing conflict has severely impacted humanitarian efforts and civilian populations, exacerbating an already dire situation [11, 12, 13, 14]. A World Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) aid convoy near Al Koma, North Darfur, was attacked [15, 16]. This attack resulted in the deaths of five members, injuries to several others, and the burning of multiple trucks [15, 16, 17].

## 3. Forward Outlook

### Subnational Perspective

An analysis of the data available as of July 2025 indicates that information regarding the classification of subnational ADM1 regions as hotspots, including the criteria for such classification (e.g., an expected increase of at least 25% in violent events), could not be verified [1]. Similarly, specific statistical data for the following regions—Central Darfur, Blue Nile, Northern, Aj Jazirah, River Nile, Khartoum, Sennar, West Darfur, and Gedaref—pertaining to average violent events over the last three months, predicted short-term violent events, and percentage increases, was not verifiable due to insufficient information [1].
