# Security Report: Sudan - The Past Year and Future Outlook

## Overview

The past year in Sudan has been defined by the escalating civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), marked by significant shifts in conflict dynamics and the expansion of hostilities to previously less affected areas. Events on the ground indicate a deepening crisis with severe humanitarian and strategic implications.

## Key Events and Developments (Last Year)

The conflict has seen a notable intensification and geographical spread, with several critical events shaping the security landscape:

*   **Escalation in Port Sudan:** A major development has been the expansion of RSF operations to Port Sudan, a vital logistical hub and the de facto administrative center for the SAF.
    *   **First RSF Drone Strikes:** The city experienced its first reported RSF paramilitary drone strikes, marking a significant escalation in the two-year civil war and demonstrating the RSF's expanding operational reach [Source 1].
    *   **Oil Depot Fires:** Just one day after these initial drone strikes, a large fire erupted at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan. While the cause remains unclear, its timing immediately following the drone attacks raises concerns about deliberate targeting of critical infrastructure [Source 1].
    *   **Targeting Civilian Facilities:** Subsequent drone attacks on Port Sudan were reported, with the Sudanese military citing official sources stating that civilian facilities, including an air base and a cargo warehouse, were targeted. These attacks reportedly led to power outages in parts of the city, and air defenses were observed at work [Source 3, Source 4].
*   **Contested Control in Nahud:** In the south of the country, the city of Nahud became a focal point of contention. Footage circulated on social media purportedly showing RSF militia in front of local administration headquarters. However, Sudanese army sources, corroborated by reports from Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera, maintained that defenses remained in place and a military garrison was holding out against RSF attacks, highlighting the ongoing struggle for territorial control [Source 2].

## Analysis and Impact

These events underscore the RSF's evolving tactical capabilities, particularly their increasing use of drone technology and their ability to strike strategic locations previously considered relatively secure. The targeting of critical infrastructure, such as oil depots and cargo warehouses, alongside civilian facilities, indicates a worrying trend towards broader economic disruption and exacerbation of the humanitarian crisis. The persistent fighting for control over cities like Nahud reflects the fragmented nature of the conflict and the severe challenges to establishing any form of stability or governance.

## Forward-Looking Perspective

The security outlook for Sudan remains bleak. The expansion of the conflict to vital areas like Port Sudan suggests that no region is entirely safe, increasing the risk of further displacement and humanitarian catastrophe. The RSF's demonstrated capacity for drone warfare indicates a shift in tactics that could prolong the conflict and make traditional defense strategies less effective.

Without a significant breakthrough in peace negotiations or decisive international intervention, the conflict is likely to remain protracted, characterized by continued fighting for strategic locations and critical infrastructure. The targeting of civilian assets will likely worsen the already dire humanitarian situation, leading to increased food insecurity, displacement, and a breakdown of essential services. A return to stability and a unified, civilian-led government appears distant, with the country facing a prolonged period of instability and fragmentation.

*   [Source 1] Editor's note: We are aware of images circulating on social media of a large fire burning at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan, Sudan. The attack has not yet been reported on by Sudanese media, and the cause of the fires is still unclear. The fires come just one day after a series of RSF paramilitary drone strikes in the city, which were the first of the country's two year civil war. We are watching our sources for more information. - Owen
*   [Source 2] Editor's note: We are aware of a report on Al Arabiya, citing a Sudanese army source, saying that defenses remain in place in the city of Nahud in the south of the country. The report appears to come in response to footage circulating on social media platforms purportedly showing Rapid Support Forces militia in front of local administration headquarters in the city. A similar report from Al Jazeera says that a military garrison in Nahud is holding out against RSF attack. We continue to monitor for further updates. - James
