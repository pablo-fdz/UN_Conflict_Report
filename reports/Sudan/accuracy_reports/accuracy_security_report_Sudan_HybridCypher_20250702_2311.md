## 1. Overview
**Section Score:** True: 75.0%, False: 0.0%, Mixture: 25.0%

### Claim 1: MIXTURE
> Sudan is experiencing a severe and escalating security crisis.

**Justification:** The provided information indicates that Sudan is experiencing security issues, with reports of RSF attacks on oil depots, an attack on Abu Shouk camp resulting in deaths, and drone attacks on a naval base. The data also shows a significant increase in violent events in several regions of Sudan, such as Blue Nile (400% increase), River Nile (200% increase), and West Darfur (100% increase). However, the question 'Has the security situation in Sudan worsened in recent months?' could not be answered due to insufficient information. While there are clear indications of ongoing conflict and instability, the claim of a 'severe and escalating' crisis is not fully substantiated by the provided text alone, as the escalation aspect is not explicitly detailed across all reported incidents or in a comparative manner over time. The data on violent events does suggest escalation in specific regions, but the overall claim's scope is broad.

- Sudanese civil defense: 

### Claim 2: TRUE
> The ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is the primary driver of the security crisis in Sudan.

**Sources:**
- Al-Jazeera: Sudan's Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group struck the Social Security Hospital in El Obeid, North Kordofan; no word on damage or injury

### Claim 3: MIXTURE
> Recent events indicate a broadening of the conflict's geographical scope.

**Justification:** The provided information indicates that the conflict in Sudan has spread to new regions, specifically mentioning airstrikes in Nyala and El Geneina (Darfur), el-Obeid, and reports of RSF militia in Nahud. This supports the claim of a broadening geographical scope. However, the answer to whether there are *new* areas experiencing conflict that were *not previously affected* is 'Not enough information to answer this question.' This suggests that while the conflict is active in more places, it's unclear if these are entirely new areas or previously affected ones experiencing renewed activity. The ACLED data shows increased activity in several regions, including West Darfur, River Nile, Khartoum, Northern, Sennar, Aj Jazirah, Blue Nile, Central Darfur, and Gedaref, which further supports the idea of a broadening scope, but doesn't specify if these are entirely *new* areas.

### Claim 4: TRUE
> Recent events indicate an intensification of hostilities in Sudan.

**Sources:**
- Editor's note: We are aware of images circulating on social media of a large fire burning at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan, Sudan. The attack has not yet been reported on by Sudanese media, and the cause of the fires is still unclear. The fires come just one day after a series of RSF paramilitary drone strikes in the city, which were the first of the country's two year civil war. We are watching our sources for more information. - Owen: 

### Claim 5: TRUE
> Drone warfare has been increasingly used in the conflict in Sudan.

**Sources:**
- Sudanese media: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/17/us-to-impose-sanctions-on-sudan-after-finding-army-used-chemical-weapons

### Claim 6: TRUE
> Khartoum State is a key area of engagement in the conflict in Sudan.

**Sources:**
- Editor's note: Military sources have told Al Jazeera that Khartoum State, Sudan, has been recaptured in full from the RSF militia by the army. A short while ago an official said that the Sudan army was "close" to recapturing all of Khartoum State, but there was also still fighting reported in Omdurman. We will update when we have a citable source confirming the army is claiming to have retaken the whole state. -Sarah

### Claim 7: TRUE
> Darfur is a key area of engagement in the conflict in Sudan.

**Sources:**
- Sudan army: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/24/sudans-conflict-explained-in-maps-and-charts

- Sarah: <URL or reference to a document>, Owen: <URL or reference to a document>, James: <URL or reference to a document>

### Claim 9: MIXTURE
> The conflict in Sudan has resulted in significant civilian casualties.

**Justification:** The provided information states that there is 'Not enough information to answer this question' regarding the number of civilian casualties and the impact of the conflict on the civilian population. However, previously verified true claims indicate an ongoing conflict with intensifying hostilities in key areas like Khartoum and Darfur, and the use of drone warfare. While these facts suggest a high likelihood of civilian casualties, the specific data to quantify 'significant civilian casualties' is missing.
**Source:** N/A or ACLED CAST

### Claim 10: MIXTURE
> The conflict in Sudan has resulted in widespread destruction of infrastructure.

**Justification:** The provided information states that there has been damage to energy infrastructure in Port Sudan, including fires at major oil depots and a drone strike hitting an ammunition depot. Key infrastructure facilities in Port Sudan have been targeted. However, the claim states 'widespread destruction of infrastructure,' and the provided details are specific to Port Sudan and do not cover the entire country or confirm widespread destruction across all of Sudan.

**Sources:**
- Sudanese civil defense: 

### Claim 11: MIXTURE
> The conflict in Sudan has resulted in a deepening humanitarian crisis.

**Justification:** The provided information states that there is not enough information to answer questions about the current humanitarian situation in Sudan or whether the conflict has led to an increase in humanitarian needs. However, previously verified true claims indicate an intensification of hostilities in Sudan and that Darfur and Khartoum are key areas of engagement. The additional context shows a significant increase in violent events in several regions of Sudan, including Khartoum, Blue Nile, and River Nile, which implies a worsening humanitarian situation due to conflict.

**Sources:**
- Editor's note: Local media is reporting that the Sudanese government has drafted contingency plans to suspend the import and export of oil from South Sudan in the event of further RSF strikes to destabilize the oil transit system. Recent drone strikes have impacted pump stations, depots and port facilities on the Red Sea.

### Claim 24: MIXTURE
> The use of drones by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has impacted naval bases.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that RSF drone attacks have targeted naval bases. However, it also states that there is not enough information to answer the question about the effect of these drone attacks on naval bases. Therefore, while the targeting is confirmed, the impact is not fully detailed, leading to a mixture conclusion.

## 2. Key Security Events
**Section Score:** True: 82.6%, False: 8.7%, Mixture: 8.7%

### Claim 1: TRUE
> The Sudanese army has reported ongoing "large-scale operations" aimed at reclaiming all of Khartoum State from the RSF.

**Sources:**
- Sudan army official: 

### Claim 2: FALSE
> Military sources have indicated that Khartoum State has been largely recaptured by the Sudanese army.

**Justification:** The provided information states that the Sudanese army has reported ongoing 'large-scale operations' aimed at reclaiming all of Khartoum State, and that Khartoum State is a key area of engagement. However, the question asks if military sources have indicated that Khartoum State has been *largely recaptured*. The provided answer confirms that military sources have indicated this, but the additional context from ACLED shows a predicted increase in violent events in Khartoum, which contradicts the idea of a largely recaptured state. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported and is likely false given the ongoing conflict and predicted increase in violence.

**Sources:**
- Al Jazeera: 

### Claim 3: TRUE
> Fighting persists in Khartoum State, particularly in the south and west of Omdurman.

**Sources:**
- Sudan army official: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/24/fighting-rages-in-sudan-as-un-warns-of-civil-war

- Al Jazeera: All flights suspended at airport in Port Sudan, Sudan, following wave of RSF paramilitary drone attacks in the city overnight

### Claim 8: MIXTURE
> RSF paramilitary drone attacks have caused large fires at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan.

**Justification:** The provided information states that pro-government Sudanese media is alleging RSF drone attacks caused a fire at an oil refinery in Port Sudan, but they do not provide a source for this claim. Additionally, there is not enough information to confirm if multiple oil depots were affected. While it is verified that RSF drone attacks have impacted oil depots and that Port Sudan has been subjected to RSF paramilitary drone attacks, the specific claim about multiple oil depots being affected by fires caused by RSF drone attacks in Port Sudan is not fully substantiated by the provided information.

**Sources:**
- Owen: 

### Claim 9: TRUE
> The Sudanese civil defense has reported that fires at oil depots in Port Sudan are now "completely" under control.

**Sources:**
- Sudanese civil defense: 

### Claim 10: TRUE
> Further drone strikes have been reported targeting civilian facilities in Port Sudan, including an air base and a cargo warehouse.

**Sources:**
- Sudanese media: 
- Sudanese military: 

### Claim 11: FALSE
> There are unverified reports of power outages in parts of Port Sudan.

**Justification:** The claim states there are unverified reports of power outages in Port Sudan. However, the provided information explicitly states that the reports are not unverified, as the Sudanese electric utility company confirmed a total power outage in Port Sudan due to damage to energy infrastructure from RSF paramilitary drone attacks.

**Sources:**
- Sudanese electric utility company: 

### Claim 12: TRUE
> A naval base in Port Sudan was reportedly hit by a drone attack.

**Sources:**
- AFP: 

### Claim 13: TRUE
> The Sudanese government has drafted contingency plans to suspend the import and export of oil from South Sudan in the event of further RSF strikes destabilizing the oil transit system.

**Sources:**
- Sudan's army: 

### Claim 17: MIXTURE
> Near El Fasher in North Darfur, RSF drone and artillery attacks reportedly injured 15 people.

**Justification:** The provided information states that near El Fasher in North Darfur, RSF drone and artillery attacks reportedly killed seven people. While the claim mentions 15 injured, the provided information only confirms 7 deaths and does not specify the number of injured. Therefore, the claim is partially supported but not fully confirmed.

**Sources:**
- Al Jazeera: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/24/sudans-army-claims-it-has-regained-complete-control-of-khartoum

### Claim 4: MIXTURE
> Port Sudan will remain a focal point of intense conflict.

**Justification:** The provided information indicates that Port Sudan is a key area of engagement in the conflict and has been subjected to drone attacks, including on its naval base and airport, leading to the suspension of flights. However, the claim states that Port Sudan 'will remain a focal point of intense conflict.' While there are ongoing attacks, the provided data does not explicitly state that it will remain a focal point of *intense* conflict in the future, nor does it provide comparative data to suggest its intensity relative to other conflict zones. The forecast data does not include Port Sudan, making it difficult to definitively confirm the claim's prediction of future intensity.

**Sources:**
- Sudanese media: 

### Claim 5: MIXTURE
> The RSF's attacks are increasing in sophistication, particularly with drones.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that the RSF is utilizing drones in their attacks, targeting various locations including civilian facilities and airports. It also states that drone warfare has become a prominent feature of the conflict and that there are reports of RSF paramilitary forces using advanced foreign air defense systems. However, the information does not directly provide evidence to support the claim that the RSF's attacks are increasing in sophistication, particularly with drones. While the use of advanced air defense systems might imply increased sophistication, this is not explicitly linked to their drone attacks in the provided text.

**Sources:**
- Not enough information to answer this question.
- Sudan state media: <URL or reference to a document>, local media: <URL or reference to a document>

### Claim 6: MIXTURE
> The RSF's attacks with drones pose a significant threat to critical infrastructure.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that RSF drone attacks have impacted critical infrastructure, specifically mentioning a power station and the Port Sudan airport. However, the information explicitly states that there is 'not enough information to answer' the question regarding the assessed level of threat posed by these attacks to critical infrastructure. Therefore, while there is evidence of impact, the extent of the threat is not fully established.

**Sources:**
- Sudanese media: 

### Claim 7: MIXTURE
> The RSF's attacks with drones pose a significant threat to civilian populations.

**Justification:** The provided information states that RSF drone attacks have resulted in civilian casualties and damage, with specific reports of eight and two civilians killed in separate incidents. However, the information also explicitly states that there is 'not enough information to answer' the question about the assessed level of threat posed by these attacks to civilian populations. Therefore, while there is evidence of harm, the overall threat level cannot be fully determined from the given data.

**Sources:**
- Sudanese government: 

### Claim 8: MIXTURE
> The potential disruption of oil transit from South Sudan through Port Sudan could have severe economic repercussions for Sudan.

**Justification:** The provided information indicates that the Sudanese government has drafted contingency plans to suspend oil transit from South Sudan through Port Sudan due to potential RSF strikes that could destabilize the system. Recent drone strikes have impacted facilities in Port Sudan, and the Sudanese government has warned South Sudan about the compromised transportation system. However, the information explicitly states that there is 'Not enough information to answer' the question about the potential economic consequences for Sudan if oil transit through Port Sudan is disrupted. Therefore, while the disruption is a possibility and has been planned for, the specific economic repercussions for Sudan are not detailed in the provided text.

**Sources:**
- Sarah: 

### Claim 9: MIXTURE
> The potential disruption of oil transit from South Sudan through Port Sudan could have severe economic repercussions for South Sudan.

**Justification:** The provided information indicates that the Sudanese government has warned South Sudan that they would be unable to facilitate the export of South Sudanese oil from Port Sudan if the transportation system is further compromised due to recent drone strikes. This directly supports the idea that disruption of oil transit could occur. However, the information does not explicitly detail the 'severe economic repercussions' for South Sudan, only that the transit itself is at risk. Therefore, while the potential for disruption is clear, the extent of the economic impact is not fully elaborated upon in the provided text.

**Sources:**
- Editor's note: Local media is reporting that the Sudanese government has drafted contingency plans to suspend the import and export of oil from South Sudan in the event of further RSF strikes to destabilize the oil transit system. Recent drone strikes have impacted pump stations, depots and port facilities on the Red Sea. Radio Tamazuj is reporting that a letter, dated Friday, showed the Sudanese government warning South Sudan that they would be unable to facilitate the export of South Sudanese oil from Port Sudan if the transportation system was further compromised. They describe the risk as high, and the contingency plans as "fast track." We will keep an eye out for any reports of further disruption along key exchange routes. -Sarah

### Claim 10: FALSE
> Based on data available in July 2025, nine subnational ADM1 regions are predicted to experience a significant increase in violent events.

**Justification:** The provided data indicates that nine subnational ADM1 regions are predicted to experience a significant increase in violent events. However, the claim specifies that this prediction is based on data available in July 2025, and the provided data does not specify a date or timeframe for these predictions. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the claim's temporal accuracy.
**Source:** N/A or ACLED CAST

### Claim 11: FALSE
> Nine subnational ADM1 regions are predicted to be conflict hotspots based on data available in July 2025.

**Justification:** The provided data lists 9 subnational ADM1 regions predicted to be conflict hotspots, but the claim states that exactly nine regions are predicted to be conflict hotspots. The data does not explicitly confirm or deny this exact number. However, the question about the number of regions is answered with 'Not enough information to answer this question.', which contradicts the claim's assertion of a specific number.
