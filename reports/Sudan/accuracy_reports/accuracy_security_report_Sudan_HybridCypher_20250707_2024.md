### Claim 16: MIXED
> An Egypt-led conference in July 2023 established a framework for political dialogue.

**Justification:** The provided information states that an Egypt-led conference in July 2023 established humanitarian corridors, but it does not confirm whether this conference also established a framework for political dialogue. The claim asserts both, making it partially supported but not fully verifiable with the given data.

**Sources:**
- Council on Foreign Relations: https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/what-extent-sudans-humanitarian-crisis, 2025-06-26

### Claim 21: FALSE
> The RSF is reportedly funded by gold sales.

**Justification:** The provided information does not contain any details about the funding of the RSF, specifically whether it is funded by gold sales. The answer to the question 'Is the RSF reportedly funded by gold sales?' is 'Not enough information to answer this question.'
**Source:** N/A or ACLED CAST

> The World Food Program described the humanitarian crisis in Sudan as 'the world’s worst humanitarian crisis'.

**Justification:** The provided information explicitly states that the World Food Program did not describe the humanitarian crisis in Sudan as 'the world's worst humanitarian crisis'. Instead, it was the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) spokesperson who made a similar statement, referring to Sudan as the world's largest and worst protection crisis.

> The ongoing conflict in Sudan has displaced more than 14 million people.

**Justification:** The provided information states that more than twelve million people have been forcibly displaced since April 2023, with over 7.7 million internally displaced and an estimated 4 million refugees. This is less than the claim of 'more than 14 million people'.

**Sources:**
- Council on Foreign Relations: https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/what-extent-sudans-humanitarian-crisis, 2025-06-26

### Claim 32: TRUE

## 2. Key Security Events
**Section Score:** True: 81.7%, False: 1.7%, Mixed: 16.7%

### Claim 1: MIXED
> On May 20, 2025, the Sudanese army fully recaptured Khartoum State from the RSF militia.

**Justification:** The claim states that the Sudanese army fully recaptured Khartoum State on May 20, 2025. While military sources reported the full recapture, an official also stated that the army was 'close' to recapturing all of Khartoum State, with fighting still reported in Omdurman. This indicates that the recapture was not complete, making the claim partially true but not fully supported.

**Sources:**
- Sudan: Khartoum: Omdurman, 19 May 2025
- sudan: Omdurman, 19 May 2025

### Claim 4: MIXED
> On May 19, 2025, the SAF seized a large quantity of RSF weapons.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that the SAF seized a large quantity of RSF weapons on May 19, 2025, in Omdurman - Al Salha. However, it does not specify the types or quantities of weapons seized, making it impossible to fully verify the claim's details.

**Sources:**
- sudan: khartoum, 19 may 2025

### Claim 5: MIXED
> On May 19, 2025, the SAF caused 3 fatalities among RSF personnel.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that on May 19, 2025, the SAF caused fatalities among RSF personnel in Omdurman, and that an unspecified number of RSF were killed and injured with fatalities coded as 3. However, the information does not explicitly state that exactly 3 RSF personnel were killed, only that fatalities were 'coded as 3'. This leaves room for interpretation and prevents a definitive 'true' conclusion.

**Sources:**
- Sudan: Omdurman, 19 May 2025
- Unknown

### Claim 6: MIXED
> On April 15, 2025, SAF regained control of the village of Al Sufayra (Um Bada).

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that SAF regained control of the village of Al Sufayra (Um Bada) on April 15, 2025. However, it also states that the specific areas within Al Sufayra that were under SAF control were not specified. Therefore, the claim is partially supported but lacks specific details.

**Sources:**
- x.com/AJABreaking: x.com/AJABreaking/status/1910539720326799427, 2025-04-11

### Claim 18: MIXED
> On April 11, 2025, RSF had reportedly captured Um Kadadah.

**Justification:** The provided information states that RSF overtook Um Kadadah on April 10, 2025, but Shugara later regained control. The claim specifies April 11, 2025, and implies continued RSF control. Since control was lost on April 10, the claim that RSF captured Um Kadadah on April 11, 2025, is not fully supported.

**Sources:**
- x.com: x.com/MUAMMAR_SUD/status/1910627006451941397, 2025-04-11

### Claim 19: TRUE
> On April 10, 2025, significant clashes occurred between RSF and Shugara-Berti in Umm Keddada.

**Sources:**
- Sudan: North Darfur: Um Kadadah, 10 April 2025
- Sudan: North Darfur: Um Kadadah, April 10, 2025

### Claim 20: TRUE
> On April 10, 2025, 10 civilian fatalities resulted from clashes in Umm Keddada.

**Sources:**
- Sudan: https://www.crisiscleanup.org/data/sudan-conflict-tracker/, 10 April 2025
- Sudan: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-country-profile-2024&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1717378600000000&usg=AOvVaw3000000000000000000000, 2024-01-01

### Claim 21: MIXED
> On April 10, 2025, 3,500 households were displaced due to clashes in Umm Keddada.

**Justification:** The claim states that 3,500 households were displaced due to clashes in Umm Keddada on April 10, 2025. The provided information confirms that on April 10, 2025, significant clashes occurred between RSF and Shugara-Berti in Umm Keddada, and that 3,500 households were displaced due to these clashes. However, it also states that on the same date, 10 civilian fatalities resulted from clashes in Umm Keddada. The claim does not mention fatalities, but the presence of fatalities alongside displacement does not inherently contradict the claim of displacement. The primary issue is that the provided information states 3,500 households were displaced, but the claim does not specify the number of fatalities. The claim is partially supported by the information regarding displacement, but the information about fatalities is not directly addressed or contradicted by the claim.

### Claim 32: MIXED
> The RSF has predominantly carried out ethnic cleansing in Darfur.

**Justification:** The provided information states that reports of ethnic cleansing have been made regarding the RSF's actions in Darfur. It also mentions that the RSF's precursor, the Janjaweed, was involved in violent operations and carried out widespread atrocities, including killings and rapes of civilians. The RSF has also been linked to ethnic violence. While these reports and links suggest a strong possibility of ethnic cleansing, the information does not definitively state that the RSF has *predominantly* carried out ethnic cleansing. Therefore, the conclusion is mixed.

### Claim 34: MIXED
> The RSF has predominantly carried out mass killings in Darfur.

**Justification:** The provided information states that the RSF's precursor, the Janjaweed, carried out widespread atrocities in Darfur, including killings of civilians. It also mentions that the RSF has been associated with human rights abuses and that mass killings and ethnic cleansing have been reported in Sudan. Specific incidents of RSF paramilitary shelling and attacks resulting in civilian deaths in El Fasher, Darfur, are also cited. However, the information does not explicitly state that the RSF has *predominantly* carried out mass killings in Darfur, which is a key part of the claim.

### Claim 56: MIXED
> Over 3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) have moved to Jebel Marrah and Tawila (North Darfur) due to clashes across Darfur states.

**Justification:** The provided information states that over 3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) have moved to Jebel Marrah and Tawila (North Darfur) due to clashes between the SAF and RSF. However, a previously verified true claim states that prior to the conflict, an estimated 3.7 million people in Sudan were internally displaced. Another verified claim states that the ongoing conflict in Sudan is the world’s largest internal displacement crisis, with over four million refugees having fled Sudan. The claim that *over 3 million* IDPs moved to Jebel Marrah and Tawila specifically is not directly supported by the provided answers, which only confirm that 'over 3 million IDPs have moved to Jebel Marrah and Tawila'. The number of IDPs in Sudan is very high, but the specific figure for these two locations is not corroborated by the provided data. The SLM/A-Nur declared a humanitarian emergency in their controlled areas of Jebel Marrah and Tawila on April 21, 2025, which implies significant displacement, but does not quantify it as 'over 3 million'.

### Claim 4: MIXED
> The Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) leadership lacks political will to hinder a meaningful resolution.

**Justification:** The provided information indicates that negotiations remain stalled due to a perceived lack of political will from both sides, which includes the SAF leadership. However, there is no specific information detailing actions taken by the SAF leadership that directly hinder a meaningful resolution, nor is there explicit confirmation of their lack of political will beyond the general statement about stalled negotiations. Therefore, while there is an indication of a lack of political will, the claim that the SAF leadership *lacks* political will to hinder a meaningful resolution is not fully supported or refuted by the provided data.

### Claim 5: FALSE
> The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) leadership lacks political will to hinder a meaningful resolution.

**Justification:** The provided information indicates that the RSF leadership has taken actions that hinder a meaningful resolution, such as formalizing a new governing coalition to establish a parallel administration, engaging in general mobilization, threatening ethnic communities, besieging El Fasher, cutting off assistance, and shelling civilian areas. While the claim states a lack of political will, the actions described directly impede resolution efforts, supporting the 'false' conclusion.

The provided information also notes that specific 'liberated' areas within Khartoum are not detailed. The ongoing fighting, even in areas claimed to be recaptured, suggests that stability is not yet fully established, leading to a mixed conclusion.
