## Section: Overview
**Section Score:** True: 71.4%, False: 0.0%, Mixture: 28.6%

### Claim 1: TRUE
> Sudan has experienced a year of intense conflict.

### Claim 2: TRUE
> The conflict in Sudan is primarily characterized by the ongoing civil war between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

### Claim 3: TRUE
> The ongoing civil war in Sudan is between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

### Claim 4: MIXTURE
> Hostilities in Sudan have significantly escalated during the past year.
**Justification:** The provided questions and answers state that there is 'Not enough information to answer' whether hostilities have significantly escalated in Sudan over the last year. While previously verified true claims mention a 'year of intense conflict' and the nature of the conflict, they do not specifically address the *escalation* of hostilities within that year. Therefore, the information is insufficient to fully support or refute the claim of significant escalation.

### Claim 5: TRUE
> The escalation of hostilities in Sudan has impacted critical infrastructure across the country.

### Claim 6: TRUE
> The escalation of hostilities in Sudan has impacted civilian populations across the country.

### Claim 7: MIXTURE
> The escalation of hostilities in Sudan has impacted humanitarian efforts across the country.
**Justification:** While the provided information confirms that the escalation of hostilities in Sudan has impacted critical infrastructure and civilian populations, and that Sudan has experienced a year of intense conflict, there is not enough information to directly confirm the impact on humanitarian efforts specifically. The questions posed about the impact on humanitarian efforts were answered with 'Not enough information to answer this question.'

## Section: Key Security Events
**Section Score:** True: 57.9%, False: 3.5%, Mixture: 38.6%

### Claim 1: TRUE
> The conflict has been marked by a series of drone strikes.

### Claim 2: MIXTURE
> The conflict has been marked by a series of ground assaults.
**Justification:** The provided information does not contain specific details about ground assaults. While it mentions drone strikes as a feature of the conflict, it does not confirm or deny the occurrence or significance of ground assaults. Therefore, the claim that the conflict has been marked by a series of ground assaults cannot be fully supported or refuted.

### Claim 3: MIXTURE
> Drone strikes and ground assaults have particularly targeted strategic locations.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that specific strategic locations such as Port Sudan, Kassala Airport, a naval base in Port Sudan, El Khawi, West Kordofan, and Al-Dabaibat, South Kordofan have been targeted by drone strikes. However, the information does not specify if these were the primary targets or what percentage of all drone strikes and ground assaults targeted strategic locations. Therefore, it is not possible to fully confirm or deny the claim that drone strikes and ground assaults have *particularly* targeted strategic locations.

### Claim 4: MIXTURE
> Drone strikes and ground assaults have particularly targeted civilian facilities.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that civilian facilities, including a cargo warehouse, an air base, a civilian terminal, a fuel depot, and a naval base, have been targeted by drone strikes and ground assaults. However, there is insufficient information to determine if these facilities were 'particularly' targeted or to establish the percentage of strikes that hit civilian facilities, which is a key aspect of the claim.

### Claim 5: TRUE
> Port Sudan has been a focal point of RSF paramilitary drone strikes.

### Claim 6: FALSE
> RSF paramilitary drone strikes in Port Sudan mark the first such attacks in the country's two-year civil war.
**Justification:** The claim states that RSF paramilitary drone strikes in Port Sudan mark the first such attacks in the country's two-year civil war. However, the provided information indicates that RSF drone strikes were reported on a military base in Kosti and the airport in Atbara during the first year of the civil war. This contradicts the claim that the Port Sudan strikes were the first of their kind in the civil war.

### Claim 7: TRUE
> RSF paramilitary drone strikes in Port Sudan have targeted civilian facilities.

### Claim 8: TRUE
> RSF paramilitary drone strikes in Port Sudan have targeted an air base.

### Claim 9: MIXTURE
> RSF paramilitary drone strikes in Port Sudan have targeted a cargo warehouse.
**Justification:** While the provided information confirms that RSF paramilitary drone strikes in Port Sudan have targeted a cargo warehouse, it does not specify which cargo warehouse was targeted. Therefore, the claim is only partially supported.

### Claim 10: MIXTURE
> Large fires have occurred at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan following RSF paramilitary drone strikes.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that large fires were reported at oil depots in Port Sudan following RSF paramilitary drone strikes. However, it does not specify the number of oil depots that experienced these fires, stating 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, the claim that 'multiple' oil depots were affected cannot be fully verified.

### Claim 11: TRUE
> Sudanese media have reported new drone attacks in Port Sudan with active air defense responses.

### Claim 12: TRUE
> There have been ongoing confrontations in Nahud.

### Claim 13: TRUE
> The Sudanese army has maintained defenses against RSF attacks in the city of Nahud.

### Claim 14: MIXTURE
> Social media footage purportedly shows RSF militia in front of local administration headquarters in Nahud.
**Justification:** While social media footage purportedly shows RSF militia in front of local administration headquarters in Nahud, there is not enough information to explicitly confirm this. The previously verified true claims establish that there have been ongoing confrontations in Nahud and that the Sudanese army has maintained defenses against RSF attacks in the city, which provides context for the claim but does not directly verify the specific visual evidence mentioned.

### Claim 15: MIXTURE
> The battle for control of Khartoum State has continued.
**Justification:** While the claim states the battle for control of Khartoum State has continued, the provided answers present conflicting information. One answer states the battle is ongoing with fighting reported in Omdurman and a large-scale operation to reclaim the state. However, another answer claims the Sudan army has regained complete control of Khartoum State after expelling remaining RSF forces, and that Khartoum State has been recaptured in full. The presence of ongoing fighting in Omdurman suggests the battle may not be entirely concluded, but the claim of the battle continuing for control is contradicted by the assertion of full recapture.

### Claim 16: TRUE
> The Sudanese army has reported gains in the battle for control of Khartoum State.

### Claim 17: TRUE
> The Sudanese army has reported recapturing areas like Al-Khawi.

### Claim 18: TRUE
> RSF drone strikes have targeted power stations in Omdurman.

### Claim 19: TRUE
> RSF forces have been involved in the capture of a prison in En Nahud.

### Claim 20: TRUE
> RSF forces have been involved in the release of inmates from a prison in En Nahud.

### Claim 21: MIXTURE
> RSF forces have been implicated in looting in En Nahud.
**Justification:** The provided information states that Sudan's government accuses RSF of looting in En Nahud. However, it also indicates that there is not enough information to specify what instances of looting in En Nahud have been attributed to RSF forces. While the accusation exists, the specifics are not detailed, leading to a mixture conclusion.

### Claim 22: MIXTURE
> RSF forces have been implicated in attacking public buildings in En Nahud.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that Sudan's government accuses RSF of attacking public buildings in En Nahud. However, it does not specify which public buildings were attacked or provide further details to corroborate this accusation. Therefore, while there is an accusation, the information is insufficient to fully verify the claim.

### Claim 23: MIXTURE
> RSF forces have been implicated in killing civilians in En Nahud.
**Justification:** The provided information states that Sudan's government accuses RSF of killing civilians in En Nahud. However, it also states that there is not enough information to answer the question about the evidence implicating RSF forces in civilian deaths in En Nahud. While there is an accusation, there is no concrete evidence provided to fully support the claim that RSF forces have been implicated in killing civilians in En Nahud.

### Claim 24: TRUE
> RSF shelling has impacted El Obeid Hospital.

### Claim 25: TRUE
> An RSF attack was reported in the Shagra area of El Fasher.

### Claim 26: TRUE
> The Sudanese government has been involved in the destruction of a plane at Nyala Airport.

### Claim 27: TRUE
> The Sudanese government has been involved in the bombing of RSF weapons stockpiles at Nyala Airport.

### Claim 28: TRUE
> The Sudanese government has been involved in the bombing of RSF fuel stockpiles at Nyala Airport.

### Claim 29: TRUE
> RSF has targeted the government-controlled airport in Kassala.

### Claim 30: TRUE
> Drones have reportedly been shot down in Kassala.

### Claim 31: TRUE
> A Twitter/X account claiming to represent the Naath Defense Forces (from Sudan) reported that the government of South Sudan launched airstrikes on Nuer civilian areas in Old Fangak.

### Claim 32: MIXTURE
> A Twitter/X account claiming to represent the Naath Defense Forces (from Sudan) reported that the government of South Sudan launched airstrikes on Nuer civilian areas in villages near Old Fangak.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that a Twitter/X account claiming to represent the Naath Defense Forces reported airstrikes by the government of South Sudan on Nuer civilian areas in Old Fangak and nearby villages. However, the information also states that there is 'not enough information to answer this question' regarding the specific villages targeted. Therefore, while the core of the claim is supported, the detail about specific villages is not fully verified.

### Claim 33: TRUE
> A cholera outbreak has been reported.

### Claim 34: TRUE
> There have been 727 cases of cholera.

### Claim 35: MIXTURE
> There have been 12 deaths from cholera.
**Justification:** The provided information states that there have been 727 cases of cholera, but it does not confirm the number of deaths. The claim specifies 12 deaths, which is not supported or contradicted by the available data.

### Claim 36: MIXTURE
> Cholera cases and deaths have been reported particularly in Khartoum.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that cholera cases and deaths have been reported in Khartoum. However, it does not specify the proportion of these cases and deaths that occurred in Khartoum, only that they have been reported there. Therefore, the claim that they have been reported 'particularly' in Khartoum cannot be fully substantiated with the given data.

### Claim 37: MIXTURE
> Cholera cases and deaths have been reported particularly in North Kordofan.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that cholera cases and deaths have been reported in North Kordofan. However, it does not provide information on the proportion of cholera cases and deaths reported in North Kordofan relative to other regions, nor does it specify if these were the only locations affected. Therefore, while the claim is partially supported, a full determination of its scope and significance cannot be made.

### Claim 38: TRUE
> The WHO has facilitated the arrival of 2.9 million doses of oral vaccine against cholera in Port Sudan.

### Claim 39: MIXTURE
> Hospitals have been bombed.
**Justification:** The provided information states that RSF shelling has impacted El Obeid Hospital. While this confirms that a hospital has been impacted by shelling, it does not explicitly state that hospitals have been bombed. The claim is too general and lacks specific details about the number of hospitals bombed or the timeframe, which are not provided in the supporting information.

### Claim 40: TRUE
> MSF's hospital in Old Fangak has been bombed.

### Claim 41: MIXTURE
> MSF's hospital in Old Fangak has been forced to close.
**Justification:** The provided information states that MSF's hospital in Old Fangak has been bombed, but it does not confirm whether it has been forced to close. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported or refuted.

### Claim 42: MIXTURE
> Widespread power cuts have affected cities like Port Sudan.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that there has been a total power outage in Port Sudan due to RSF paramilitary drone attacks damaging energy infrastructure. However, the information also states that there is 'Not enough information to answer' the question about how widespread the power cuts have been. Therefore, while power cuts have occurred, the extent of their 'widespread' nature cannot be fully confirmed.

### Claim 43: TRUE
> Widespread power cuts have affected cities like Khartoum.

### Claim 44: MIXTURE
> Widespread power cuts have affected cities like Wadi Halfa.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms widespread power cuts in Wadi Halfa, but the extent of these power cuts is not specified, making it impossible to fully verify the claim's scope.

### Claim 45: TRUE
> Widespread power cuts are attributed to damage to energy infrastructure.

### Claim 46: TRUE

### Claim 51: TRUE
> UAE ships have reportedly cooperated with the RSF.

### Claim 52: MIXTURE
> A sweeping reshuffle of key state government positions has occurred in Warrap.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that a reshuffle of key state government positions has occurred in Warrap. However, it explicitly states that there is not enough information to determine which specific positions were reshuffled, making it impossible to confirm the 'sweeping' nature of the reshuffle.

### Claim 53: MIXTURE
> A sweeping reshuffle of key state government positions has occurred in Central Equatoria.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that a reshuffle of key state government positions has occurred in Central Equatoria. However, it explicitly states that there is not enough information to identify which specific positions were reshuffled. Therefore, the claim that it was a 'sweeping' reshuffle cannot be fully verified.

### Claim 54: MIXTURE
> A sweeping reshuffle of key state government positions has occurred in Upper Nile.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that a reshuffle of key state government positions has occurred in Upper Nile, but it does not specify which positions were affected. Therefore, the claim that it was a 'sweeping' reshuffle cannot be fully verified.

### Claim 55: TRUE
> There was a Government Dissolution.

### Claim 56: MIXTURE
> There was an Oath Taking by Kamil Idriss.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that Kamil Idriss took an oath, but it does not specify the position for which the oath was taken. Therefore, the claim is only partially supported.

## Section: Forward-Looking Perspective
**Section Score:** True: 39.1%, False: 4.3%, Mixture: 56.5%

### Claim 1: TRUE
> The security situation in Sudan is likely to remain volatile based on the events of the past year.

### Claim 2: TRUE
> The RSF has been using drone strikes.

### Claim 3: TRUE
> The RSF has been targeting critical infrastructure.

### Claim 4: MIXTURE
> The RSF's use of drone strikes and targeting of critical infrastructure suggests an ongoing strategy to disrupt government control.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that the RSF has been using drone strikes and targeting critical infrastructure, and that the escalation of hostilities has impacted critical infrastructure. However, there is not enough information to directly link these actions to a specific strategy of disrupting government control. While it can be inferred that targeting critical infrastructure might disrupt government control, the information does not explicitly state this as the RSF's strategy.

### Claim 5: MIXTURE
> The RSF's use of drone strikes and targeting of critical infrastructure suggests an ongoing strategy to exert pressure.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that the RSF has been using drone strikes and targeting critical infrastructure. However, the specific question regarding whether these actions are part of a strategy to exert pressure on the government or other entities is answered with 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, while the actions are confirmed, the strategic intent behind them is not supported by the provided data.

### Claim 6: TRUE
> The Sudanese army is making efforts to regain control in various areas.

### Claim 7: MIXTURE
> The Sudanese army's efforts to regain control in various areas indicate a protracted conflict.
**Justification:** The claim states that the Sudanese army's efforts to regain control in various areas indicate a protracted conflict. While the previously verified true claims confirm that the Sudanese army is making efforts to regain control in various areas and that Sudan has experienced a year of intense conflict, there is not enough information to directly link these efforts to the indication of a protracted conflict. The provided information does not explicitly state that these specific efforts are indicative of a protracted conflict, nor does it offer military analyses or reports to support this specific interpretation.

### Claim 8: MIXTURE
> The humanitarian impact of the conflict in Sudan is severe.
**Justification:** While the claim states the humanitarian impact is severe, the provided Q&A does not contain specific information to confirm or deny this. However, several previously verified true claims indirectly suggest a severe humanitarian impact, such as reports of attacks on aid convoys, a cholera outbreak, widespread power cuts due to damaged infrastructure, and the conflict impacting civilian populations. Without direct confirmation from the Q&A, a definitive 'true' cannot be given, but the indirect evidence points towards a severe impact, making 'mixture' the most appropriate conclusion.

### Claim 9: TRUE
> The humanitarian impact includes health crises.

### Claim 10: TRUE
> The humanitarian impact includes infrastructure damage.

### Claim 11: MIXTURE
> The severe humanitarian impact is expected to persist.
**Justification:** The provided information states that there is not enough information to answer whether humanitarian organizations project that the current severe humanitarian impact in Sudan will continue in the short to medium term. However, the previously verified true claims indicate that Sudan has experienced a year of intense conflict, the escalation of hostilities has impacted critical infrastructure and civilian populations, there are ongoing confrontations, and the security situation is likely to remain volatile. These factors suggest a continued humanitarian impact, but without a direct projection from humanitarian organizations, the claim cannot be fully confirmed as true.

### Claim 12: MIXTURE
> Continued international aid is necessitated by the severe humanitarian impact.
**Justification:** The claim states that continued international aid is necessitated by the severe humanitarian impact. While the provided information confirms a severe humanitarian impact due to a year of intense conflict, including health crises and infrastructure damage, it does not explicitly state that international aid agencies have declared continued aid necessary. The answer to the question 'Have international aid agencies stated that continued aid is necessary due to the severe humanitarian situation in Sudan?' is 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, the claim is a mixture as the humanitarian impact is established, but the necessity of continued aid by agencies is not confirmed by the provided data.

### Claim 13: MIXTURE
> Continued international attention is necessitated by the severe humanitarian impact.
**Justification:** The claim states that continued international attention is necessitated by the severe humanitarian impact. While the previously verified true claims establish that Sudan has experienced a severe humanitarian impact due to conflict, including health crises and infrastructure damage, and that the security situation remains volatile, there is no direct information provided that confirms whether international bodies or governments have called for continued attention to this impact. The question 'Have international bodies or governments called for continued attention to Sudan's severe humanitarian impact?' was answered with 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported or refuted.

### Claim 14: MIXTURE
> There are allegations of external support for the RSF.
**Justification:** The provided information does not contain any direct confirmation or denial of external support for the RSF. While there is a mention of UAE ships reportedly cooperating with the RSF, this is not explicitly stated as external support. The question regarding credible allegations from international bodies or governments about external support for the RSF is marked as 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported or refuted.

### Claim 15: TRUE
> International sanctions have been imposed.

### Claim 16: TRUE
> The allegations of external support for the RSF could further complicate the conflict dynamics.

### Claim 17: MIXTURE
> The allegations of external support for the RSF could further complicate international relations.
**Justification:** The provided information does not directly confirm or deny whether allegations of external support for the RSF could further complicate international relations. While it is stated that 'The allegations of external support for the RSF could further complicate the conflict dynamics,' and that 'Sudan has accused the UAE of violating international conventions' and 'UAE ships have reportedly cooperated with the RSF,' there is no direct information linking these allegations to the complication of *international relations* specifically. The question about diplomatic assessments regarding the impact on international relations was also answered with 'Not enough information to answer this question.'

### Claim 18: MIXTURE
> The imposition of international sanctions could further complicate the conflict dynamics.
**Justification:** The provided information states that the US is set to impose sanctions on Sudan, and that international sanctions have been imposed. However, the specific question about whether conflict analyses suggest that international sanctions could complicate the dynamics of the conflict in Sudan is answered with 'Not enough information to answer this question.' While the claim is plausible given the context of sanctions being imposed and the general volatility of the conflict, the direct link between sanctions and complicating conflict dynamics is not explicitly supported or refuted by the provided data.

### Claim 19: TRUE
> The imposition of international sanctions could further complicate international relations.

### Claim 20: MIXTURE
> Without a significant shift in the conflict's trajectory, Sudan is poised for continued instability.
**Justification:** The provided information states that 'current assessments by security analysts predict continued instability in Sudan if the conflict's trajectory does not significantly change?' has 'Not enough information to answer this question.' However, the previously verified true claims indicate that Sudan has experienced a year of intense conflict, the conflict is between the Sudanese army and the RSF, and the security situation is likely to remain volatile based on the events of the past year. This suggests a high probability of continued instability, but without direct confirmation from security analysts as requested by the question, the claim cannot be definitively confirmed as true.

### Claim 21: FALSE
> Without a significant shift in the conflict's trajectory, Sudan is poised for continued humanitarian challenges.
**Justification:** The provided information does not contain any data that directly answers whether humanitarian organizations predict continued humanitarian challenges in Sudan without a significant shift in the conflict's trajectory. The question posed to the knowledge base returned 'Not enough information to answer this question.'

### Claim 22: MIXTURE
> Without a political resolution, Sudan is poised for continued instability.
**Justification:** The provided information states that there is 'Not enough information to answer this question' regarding whether political analysts predict continued instability without a political resolution. However, the previously verified true claims indicate a year of intense conflict, ongoing civil war, escalation of hostilities impacting infrastructure and civilians, drone strikes, confrontations, reported gains by the Sudanese army, and a volatile security situation. These factors strongly suggest that instability is likely to continue, but the direct link to the absence of a political resolution is not explicitly confirmed by the provided answers.

### Claim 23: MIXTURE
> Without a political resolution, Sudan is poised for continued humanitarian challenges.
**Justification:** The provided information states that there is 'Not enough information to answer this question' regarding whether humanitarian experts predict continued challenges without a political resolution. However, the previously verified true claims indicate a year of intense conflict, ongoing civil war, impacts on critical infrastructure and civilian populations, drone strikes, shelling, cholera outbreaks, attacks on aid convoys, and widespread power cuts. These factors strongly suggest that humanitarian challenges are likely to continue, but the direct link to the absence of a political resolution is not explicitly confirmed by expert predictions in the provided Q&A.
