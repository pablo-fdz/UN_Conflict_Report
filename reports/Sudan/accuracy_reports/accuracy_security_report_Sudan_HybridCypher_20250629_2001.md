### Claim 1: TRUE
> Sudan has experienced a year of intense conflict.
**Sources:**
- Sudan army official: 

### Claim 2: TRUE
> The conflict in Sudan is primarily characterized by the ongoing civil war between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
**Sources:**
- Sudan army official: <URL>
- Sudanese media: <URL>

### Claim 3: TRUE
> The ongoing civil war in Sudan is between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
**Sources:**
- Sudanese media: 

### Claim 4: MIXTURE
> Hostilities in Sudan have significantly escalated during the past year.
**Justification:** The provided information does not directly confirm or deny the claim that hostilities have significantly escalated in the past year. While it is stated that Sudan has experienced a year of intense conflict, and the conflict is between the Sudanese army and the RSF, there is no specific information detailing an escalation trend within that year. The answers to the questions about escalation and trends are 'Not enough information to answer this question.'
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 5: TRUE
> The escalation of hostilities in Sudan has impacted critical infrastructure across the country.
**Sources:**
- Editor's note: Local media is reporting that the Sudanese government has drafted contingency plans to suspend the import and export of oil from South Sudan in the event of further RSF strikes to destabilize the oil transit system. Recent drone strikes have impacted pump stations, depots and port facilities on the Red Sea. Radio Tamazuj is reporting that a letter, dated Friday, showed the Sudanese government warning South Sudan that they would be unable to facilitate the export of South Sudanese oil from Port Sudan if the transportation system was further compromised. They describe the risk as high, and the contingency plans as "fast track." We will keep an eye out for any reports of further disruption along key exchange routes. -Sarah:

### Claim 6: TRUE
> The escalation of hostilities in Sudan has impacted civilian populations across the country.
**Sources:**
- RSF: RSF

### Claim 7: MIXTURE
> The escalation of hostilities in Sudan has impacted humanitarian efforts across the country.
**Justification:** The provided answers state 'Not enough information to answer this question' regarding the impact of hostilities on humanitarian efforts. However, a previously verified true claim states that 'The escalation of hostilities in Sudan has impacted critical infrastructure across the country' and 'The escalation of hostilities in Sudan has impacted civilian populations across the country.' While not directly stating an impact on humanitarian efforts, the impact on infrastructure and civilians strongly suggests that humanitarian efforts would be affected. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, leading to a 'mixture' conclusion.

### Claim 1: TRUE
> The conflict has been marked by a series of drone strikes.
**Sources:**
- local media: 

### Claim 2: MIXTURE
> The conflict has been marked by a series of ground assaults.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that ground assaults were a feature of the conflict, citing specific examples like clashes in Omdurman and fighting for control of North Darfur. However, the claim states 'a series of ground assaults,' and the information does not quantify the number of ground assaults or confirm if they occurred in a 'series.' Therefore, while ground assaults did occur, the extent and frequency implied by 'a series' cannot be fully verified.
**Sources:**
- Al Arabiya: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/15/sudans-armed-forces-rsf-clash-in-khartoum

### Claim 3: MIXTURE
> Drone strikes and ground assaults have particularly targeted strategic locations.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that drone strikes targeted strategic locations such as an air base, a naval base, and an airport. However, there is not enough information to determine whether ground assaults also targeted strategic locations.
**Sources:**
- Sudanese military: 

### Claim 4: MIXTURE
> Drone strikes and ground assaults have particularly targeted civilian facilities.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that civilian facilities were targeted by drone strikes, specifically a cargo warehouse and a civilian terminal. However, there is not enough information to determine if civilian facilities were targeted by ground assaults. Therefore, the claim that both drone strikes and ground assaults have particularly targeted civilian facilities is only partially supported.
**Sources:**
- Sudanese military: 

### Claim 5: TRUE
> Port Sudan has been a focal point of RSF paramilitary drone strikes.
**Sources:**
- Owen: 

### Claim 6: TRUE
> RSF paramilitary drone strikes in Port Sudan mark the first such attacks in the country's two-year civil war.
**Sources:**
- Editor's note: We are aware of images circulating on social media of a large fire burning at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan, Sudan. The attack has not yet been reported on by Sudanese media, and the cause of the fires is still unclear. The fires come just one day after a series of RSF paramilitary drone strikes in the city, which were the first of the country's two year civil war. We are watching our sources for more information. - Owen

Editor's note: Pro-government Sudanese media outlet Sudan Akhbar are alleging that the fire burning at an oil refinery in Port Sudan was sparked by an RSF drone attack. They do not provide a source for this claim, instead claiming to have access to eyewitness videos not linked in the article. The allegation would track with yesterday's RSF attack on the Port Sudan airport and nearby military base. We are watching for confirmation of RSF's involvement in the fire. - Owen

### Claim 27: MIXTURE
> The Sudanese government has been involved in the bombing of RSF weapons stockpiles at Nyala Airport.
**Justification:** The provided information states that unnamed Sudanese military sources claim to have bombed RSF weapons and fuel stockpiles at Nyala Airport. However, another question explicitly states there is not enough information to determine if the Sudanese government was involved. While the Sudanese government was involved in the destruction of a plane at Nyala Airport, this does not directly confirm their involvement in bombing RSF weapons stockpiles at the same location.
**Sources:**
- unnamed military source: 

### Claim 28: MIXTURE
> The Sudanese government has been involved in the bombing of RSF fuel stockpiles at Nyala Airport.
**Justification:** The provided information states that unnamed Sudanese military sources claim to have bombed RSF weapons and fuel stockpiles at Nyala Airport. However, another question directly asks if the Sudanese government was involved in bombing RSF fuel stockpiles at Nyala Airport, and the answer is 'Not enough information to answer this question.' While the Sudanese government was involved in the destruction of a plane at Nyala Airport, this does not directly confirm their involvement in bombing RSF fuel stockpiles at the same location.

### Claim 34: TRUE
> There have been 727 cases of cholera.
**Sources:**
- Sudan's health ministry: 

### Claim 35: MIXTURE
> There have been 12 deaths from cholera.
**Justification:** The provided information states that Sudan's health ministry reports 12 deaths and 727 cholera cases identified across the country as of May 31. However, it also mentions that Sudan's health ministry reports 25 cholera-related deaths and more than 900 infections in Khartoum on Tuesday, and that at least 70 people died in Khartoum, Sudan, as of Wednesday amid ongoing cholera outbreak. The claim states there have been 12 deaths from cholera, which is supported by one part of the information but contradicted by other parts that report higher numbers of deaths.
**Sources:**
- Sudan's health ministry: 

### Claim 36: TRUE
> Cholera cases and deaths have been reported particularly in Khartoum.
**Sources:**
- Sudan's health ministry:

### Claim 4: TRUE
> The RSF's use of drone strikes and targeting of critical infrastructure suggests an ongoing strategy to disrupt government control.
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 5: MIXTURE
> The RSF's use of drone strikes and targeting of critical infrastructure suggests an ongoing strategy to exert pressure.
**Justification:** The provided information confirms that the RSF has used drone strikes and targeted critical infrastructure, leading to disruptions. However, there is insufficient information to definitively conclude that this is a deliberate strategy to exert pressure, as the intent behind these actions is not explicitly stated.
**Sources:**
- Sudanese military: <URL or reference to a document>

### Claim 6: TRUE
> The Sudanese army is making efforts to regain control in various areas.
**Sources:**
- Al Jazeera: 

### Claim 7: TRUE
> The Sudanese army's efforts to regain control in various areas indicate a protracted conflict.
**Sources:**
- Sudan army official: 

### Claim 8: MIXTURE
> The humanitarian impact of the conflict in Sudan is severe.
**Justification:** The provided information states that the conflict in Sudan has impacted civilian populations and critical infrastructure, and that there have been reports of a cholera outbreak and attacks on hospitals and aid convoys. However, the specific questions about the estimated number of people affected and whether international organizations have declared the situation severe are answered with 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, while there are indications of a severe humanitarian impact, the claim cannot be fully substantiated with the given data.
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 9: TRUE
> The humanitarian impact includes health crises.
**Sources:**
- Al Jazeera: Sudan's Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group struck the Social Security Hospital in El Obeid, North Kordofan; no word on damage or injury
- Sudan's health ministry says 12 deaths and 727 cholera cases identified across the country as of May 31 [corrects date]

### Claim 10: TRUE
> The humanitarian impact includes infrastructure damage.
**Sources:**
- Al-Jazeera: Sudan's Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group struck the Social Security Hospital in El Obeid, North Kordofan; no word on damage or injury

### Claim 11: MIXTURE
> The severe humanitarian impact is expected to persist.
**Justification:** The provided information indicates that Sudan has experienced a year of intense conflict, with ongoing civil war between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict has led to widespread impacts on critical infrastructure and civilian populations, including health crises like a cholera outbreak and damage to hospitals. There are also reports of attacks on aid convoys and widespread power cuts. While the claim states the severe humanitarian impact is expected to persist, the provided answers to specific questions about projections from humanitarian organizations and factors suggesting continuation of the crisis state 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, while the current situation clearly demonstrates a severe humanitarian impact, the information is insufficient to confirm or deny the expectation of its persistence.
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 12: MIXTURE
> Continued international aid is necessitated by the severe humanitarian impact.
**Justification:** The claim states that continued international aid is necessitated by the severe humanitarian impact. While the provided information confirms a severe humanitarian impact in Sudan, including a year of intense conflict, damage to critical infrastructure, civilian casualties, and a cholera outbreak, it does not explicitly state whether continued international aid is necessary or if it is currently being provided at a sufficient level. The questions asked about the current level of international aid and the stated necessity of continued aid by organizations were not answered with sufficient information.
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 13: MIXTURE
> Continued international attention is necessitated by the severe humanitarian impact.
**Justification:** The claim states that continued international attention is necessitated by the severe humanitarian impact. While the provided verified true claims extensively detail the severe humanitarian impact of the conflict in Sudan, including health crises, infrastructure damage, attacks on aid convoys, and displacement, the answers to the specific questions about whether international bodies or governments have called for continued attention, or if there are ongoing diplomatic efforts or media coverage indicating such a need, are 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, while the premise of severe humanitarian impact is well-established, the direct evidence for the necessity of *continued international attention* based on explicit calls or ongoing efforts is missing from the provided information.
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 14: TRUE
> There are allegations of external support for the RSF.
**Sources:**
- local media: 

### Claim 15: TRUE
> International sanctions have been imposed.
**Sources:**
- US: 

### Claim 16: MIXTURE
> The allegations of external support for the RSF could further complicate the conflict dynamics.
**Justification:** The claim states that allegations of external support for the RSF could further complicate conflict dynamics. While the provided information confirms that there are allegations of external support for the RSF (specifically, RSF paramilitary forces are reportedly using advanced foreign air defense systems), it does not provide enough information to definitively conclude whether this support is influencing the progression of the conflict or altering the balance of power/military strategies. Therefore, the claim that it *could further complicate* the dynamics is plausible but not fully substantiated by the provided data.
**Sources:**
- local media: 

### Claim 17: MIXTURE
> The allegations of external support for the RSF could further complicate international relations.
**Justification:** The provided information states that there are allegations of external support for the RSF and that the US is set to impose sanctions on Sudan, and Sudan has accused the UAE of violating international conventions, and UAE ships have reportedly cooperated with the RSF. However, the answers to the specific questions about whether these allegations have led to diplomatic tensions or if experts believe they impact diplomatic ties are 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, while the context suggests potential complications, there is no direct evidence provided to confirm that the allegations of external support have *further complicated* international relations.
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 18: MIXTURE
> The imposition of international sanctions could further complicate the conflict dynamics.
**Justification:** The claim states that international sanctions could further complicate conflict dynamics. While the provided information confirms that international sanctions have been imposed on Sudan and that the conflict is ongoing and complex, it does not offer specific details or analyses on how these sanctions have *already* affected or *will* affect the conflict dynamics. The questions posed about the impact of sanctions on military capabilities, strategies, or overall conflict dynamics were answered with 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, while it's plausible that sanctions could complicate dynamics, the provided data does not sufficiently support this specific assertion.
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 19: MIXTURE
> The imposition of international sanctions could further complicate international relations.
**Justification:** The claim states that international sanctions could further complicate international relations. While the provided information confirms that international sanctions have been imposed on Sudan and that Sudan has accused the UAE of violating international conventions, and UAE ships have reportedly cooperated with the RSF, there is no direct information linking these sanctions to a complication of international relations. The questions asked about sanctions and diplomatic disagreements in Sudan did not yield sufficient information. Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the context of sanctions being imposed, but the direct impact on international relations is not sufficiently evidenced.
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 20: MIXTURE
> Without a significant shift in the conflict's trajectory, Sudan is poised for continued instability.
**Justification:** The provided information states that there is not enough information to answer the question about current projections for Sudan's stability if the conflict continues on its present course, nor is there enough information to answer whether expert opinions link the current conflict trajectory to a high likelihood of continued instability. However, the previously verified true claims indicate a year of intense conflict, ongoing civil war between the Sudanese army and the RSF, drone strikes, attacks on critical infrastructure and civilian populations, and efforts by both sides to gain control in various areas. These facts collectively suggest a volatile and unstable situation, but without direct projections or expert opinions on the *continuation* of instability based on the *current trajectory*, a definitive 'true' or 'false' cannot be reached. Therefore, the claim is a mixture because while the ongoing conflict implies instability, the specific link between the *current trajectory* and *continued instability* is not explicitly supported by the provided data.
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 21: FALSE
> Without a significant shift in the conflict's trajectory, Sudan is poised for continued humanitarian challenges.
**Justification:** The provided information does not contain specific details about predicted humanitarian challenges if the conflict trajectory does not change significantly. The answers to the relevant questions state 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported or refuted.
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 22: MIXTURE
> Without a political resolution, Sudan is poised for continued instability.
**Justification:** The provided information does not directly answer whether continued instability is predicted without a political resolution. However, the previously verified true claims indicate a year of intense conflict, ongoing civil war, escalation of hostilities impacting infrastructure and civilians, drone strikes, confrontations in multiple cities, and a volatile security situation. These facts strongly suggest that instability is likely to continue, but the direct link to the absence of a political resolution is not explicitly stated in the provided answers.
**Source:** N/A

### Claim 23: MIXTURE
> Without a political resolution, Sudan is poised for continued humanitarian challenges.
**Justification:** The provided information does not directly answer whether Sudan is poised for continued humanitarian challenges without a political resolution. While the previously verified true claims establish that Sudan has experienced a year of intense conflict, with ongoing civil war, escalation of hostilities impacting critical infrastructure and civilian populations, and specific incidents like drone strikes and cholera outbreaks, there is no explicit statement or inference that links the absence of a political resolution to the continuation of these humanitarian challenges. The questions posed to the knowledge base were also not answered, indicating a lack of direct information on this specific causal link.
