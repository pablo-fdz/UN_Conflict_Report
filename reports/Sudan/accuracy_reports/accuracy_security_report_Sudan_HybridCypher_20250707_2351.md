### Claim 6: FALSE
> As of July 2, 2025, the war in Sudan is in its third year.

**Justification:** The claim states that the war in Sudan is in its third year as of July 2, 2025. However, the provided information indicates that the war began on April 15, 2023.

The claim is false.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that RSF forces shelled the Abu Shouk camp in El Fasher, North Darfur on April 23, 2025. However, the claim specifically mentions the Al-Quba neighborhood, and while the provided answer states RSF forces shelled Al-Quba neighborhood of El Fasher on April 23, 2025, it also cites a source that is dated 2025-04-23, which is a future date. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified as true.

### Claim 20: MIXED
> On May 11, 2025, the Sudanese army carried out airstrikes against RSF (Rapid Support Forces) positions in the El Geneina area of South Darfur.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that on May 11, 2025, the Sudanese army carried out airstrikes against RSF positions in the Nyala area of South Darfur. However, the claim specifies El Geneina as the location, while the verified information states Nyala. Therefore, the claim is partially supported but contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the location.

**Sources:**
- sudanakhbar.com: https://www.sudanakhbar.com/1647482, 2025-05-11

**Sources:**
- null

### Claim 25: FALSE
> On May 20, 2025, military sources indicated that Khartoum State had been fully recaptured from the RSF (Rapid Support Forces) by the army.

**Justification:** The claim states that on May 20, 2025, military sources indicated that Khartoum State had been fully recaptured from the RSF by the army. While the provided Q&A confirms that military sources indicated this on May 20, 2025, the previously verified true claims show ongoing clashes and RSF activity in various parts of Sudan, including Khartoum, up to May 19, 2025. Specifically, on May 19, 2025, clashes continued in Omdurman - Al Salha, Khartoum, with the SAF regaining control of only a 'significant portion' of the area, not the entire state. This ongoing conflict and partial recapture contradict the claim of a full recapture of Khartoum State by May 20, 2025.

### Claim 29: FALSE
> The RSF (Rapid Support Forces) had previously overtaken Dibebad on June 21, 2023.

**Justification:** The provided information explicitly states that the RSF (Rapid Support Forces) regained control of Dibebad on May 23, 2025, which contradicts the claim that they had previously overtaken it on June 21, 2023. The provided information does not mention the RSF overtaking Dibebad on June 21, 2023.

**Sources:**

### Claim 30: TRUE

The provided information confirms that clashes occurred in Dibebad on May 23, 2025, between SAF and RSF forces, and that the Joint Forces claimed to have inflicted losses on RSF personnel and equipment. However, the specific number of fatalities is stated as 'unspecified fatalities coded as 10', which is ambiguous and does not definitively confirm 10 RSF personnel were killed. Therefore, the claim is partially supported but not fully confirmed.

**Sources:**
- x.com/AJA_Egypt: x.com/AJA_Egypt/status/1918718919809880568, 2025-05-03

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that clashes occurred between SAF and RSF in Dibebad on May 23, 2025, and that SAF regained control of Dibebad. It also states that the Joint Forces claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on RSF personnel. However, the information does not specify the number of SAF soldiers killed in Dibebad on that date. The answer to the question 'How many SAF (Sudanese Armed Forces) soldiers were killed in Dibebad on May 23, 2025?' is '1 SAF soldier was killed.' but this is presented alongside 'null', making the exact number of casualties uncertain from the provided data.

### Claim 39: MIXED
> An unspecified number of RSF (Rapid Support Forces) fatalities, coded as 3, resulted from clashes in southwestern Bout on June 14, 2025.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that clashes occurred between RSF and SAF in southwestern Bout on June 14, 2025, and that an unspecified number of RSF were killed. However, the claim specifies that the fatalities were 'coded as 3', which is not supported by the provided information.

**Sources:**

### Claim 43: MIXED
> Rescue efforts for the mine collapse in River Nile state on June 28, 2025, were reportedly delayed due to poor road conditions.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that rescue efforts for the mine collapse in River Nile state on June 28, 2025, were delayed due to poor road conditions. However, another piece of information states the delay was due to the remote location. Since both reasons are mentioned, the claim is partially supported but not fully confirmed as solely due to poor road conditions.

**Sources:**

### Claim 44: FALSE
> Before the civil war, nearly 16 million people in Sudan faced severe food insecurity.

**Justification:** The provided information does not contain any data about the number of people facing severe food insecurity in Sudan before the civil war. The question 'How many people in Sudan faced severe food insecurity before the civil war?' was answered with 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.
**Source:** N/A or ACLED CAST

### Claim 45: TRUE
> Before the civil war, an estimated 3.7 million people in Sudan were internally displaced.

### Claim 46: TRUE

### Claim 47: MIXED
> The current conflict has led to the displacement of over 14 million people in Sudan.

**Justification:** The claim states that over 14 million people have been displaced in Sudan due to the current conflict. The provided information states that more than 12 million people have been forcibly displaced since April 2023. While this is close to the claimed figure, it is not exactly the same, and the claim specifies 'over 14 million', which is not directly supported by the provided data. Therefore, the claim is partially supported but not fully confirmed.

### Claim 48: TRUE

**Sources:**

### Claim 49: MIXED
> The World Food Program (WFP) describes the humanitarian situation in Sudan as the 'world’s worst humanitarian crisis'.

**Justification:** The provided information states that the World Food Program (WFP) describes the humanitarian situation in Sudan as a "full-blown regional crisis". However, a previously verified true claim states that the WFP has characterized the situation in Sudan as "the world’s worst humanitarian crisis". These two descriptions are different, leading to a mixed conclusion.

> The SAF regained control of a large portion of Omdurman - Al Salha on May 19, 2025.

**Sources:**
- Sudan: Khartoum: Omdurman, 19 May 2025

### Claim 15: FALSE
> Military sources reported the full recapture of Khartoum State from the RSF by May 20, 2025.

**Justification:** The claim states that military sources reported the full recapture of Khartoum State from the RSF by May 20, 2025. While one answer indicates that military sources told Al Jazeera that Khartoum State has been fully recaptured by the army, another provided fact states that on May 20, 2025, fighting was still reported in Omdurman, Khartoum. This directly contradicts the claim of a full recapture by that date.

### Claim 21: MIXED
> West Darfur remains a critical hotspot for violence.

**Justification:** The provided information states that West Darfur, specifically El Geneina, has been identified as a primary location for ethnically driven mass killings and the weaponization of sexual violence. However, the specific violent incidents reported in the 'Are there frequent reports of violent incidents in West Darfur?' question primarily detail events in Central Darfur (Zalingei) and North Darfur (El Fashar), not West Darfur. While the claim that West Darfur is a critical hotspot for violence is supported by one answer, the other answer does not provide specific examples of violence occurring in West Darfur, instead focusing on other regions of Darfur. Therefore, the information is partially supportive but not fully conclusive for West Darfur specifically.
