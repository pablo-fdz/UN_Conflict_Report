### Claim 2: MIXED
> The ongoing conflict in Sudan is primarily between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

**Justification:** The claim states that the conflict is *primarily* between the SAF and RSF. While the provided answers confirm that the SAF and RSF are the main factions involved, one answer also mentions that the Sudan Founding Alliance (associated with RSF) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (North) (Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction) are also involved. This indicates that while SAF and RSF are the primary belligerents, other groups also participate in the conflict, making the claim partially true but not entirely comprehensive.

### Claim 3: MIXED
> Intensified hostilities occurred between April 2025 and July 2025.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms intensified hostilities in Sudan during April, May, and June of 2025. However, there is insufficient information to confirm intensified hostilities in July 2025. Therefore, the claim that hostilities intensified between April 2025 and July 2025 is only partially supported.

### Claim 6: MIXED
> The conflict has led to widespread displacement.

**Justification:** While the claim states that the conflict has led to widespread displacement, the provided answers do not offer specific numbers for internally displaced persons or refugees. However, the answers do indicate that 'clashes and large-scale displacement' are occurring, and specific regions like North Darfur, El Fasher, and Zamzam camp have experienced significant displacement, with hundreds of thousands potentially displaced to Tawila. This partial information supports the idea of displacement but lacks the comprehensive data to confirm it as 'widespread' in a definitive sense.

### Claim 8: MIXED
> The conflict has led to disruptions to essential services.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms disruptions to electricity grids and healthcare facilities due to the conflict in Sudan. However, there is insufficient information to determine the impact on water supply systems and communication networks. Therefore, the claim that the conflict has led to disruptions to essential services is partially supported.
