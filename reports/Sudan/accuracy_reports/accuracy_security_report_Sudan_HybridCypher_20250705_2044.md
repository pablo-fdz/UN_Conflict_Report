### Claim 2: MIXED
> The ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is the primary driver of Sudan's security situation.

**Justification:** The provided information confirms that the conflict between the SAF and RSF is a significant factor in Sudan's security situation, with numerous clashes reported. However, it does not explicitly state that this conflict is the *primary* driver of all current security challenges. Furthermore, the information states that there is 'not enough information' to determine if other significant factors contribute to Sudan's security situation. Therefore, while the SAF-RSF conflict is a major contributor, the claim that it is the *primary* driver cannot be fully substantiated with the given information.

### Claim 5: MIXED
> The conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has seen widespread fighting across River Nile.

**Justification:** The provided information indicates that River Nile state is experiencing some conflict activity, specifically a drone attack in Atbara on April 25, 2025. However, the claim states 'widespread fighting,' and the information does not confirm the extent or widespread nature of the fighting in River Nile state. The first question also states 'Not enough information to answer this question.' Therefore, the claim is only partially supported.

### Claim 8: MIXED
> The conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has seen widespread fighting across South Darfur.

**Justification:** While the provided information confirms that South Darfur is a region with substantial conflict activity involving the SAF and RSF, specifically mentioning the use of advanced foreign air defense systems by RSF paramilitary forces in the region, it does not explicitly state that there has been widespread fighting across South Darfur. The first question regarding significant fighting in South Darfur received an 'Not enough information to answer this question' response. Therefore, the claim is partially supported but not fully confirmed.

### Claim 1: FALSE
> Nine subnational ADM1 regions are identified as hotspots based on current data.

**Justification:** The provided data does not specify the number of subnational ADM1 regions identified as hotspots, nor does it list their names. The claim states there are nine such regions, but this information is not present in the provided context.
