**Section Score:** True: 89.7%, False: 6.9%, Mixed: 3.4%

### Claim 1: FALSE

**Justification:** The provided data lists nine subnational ADM1 regions that are classified as hotspots: Central Darfur, Blue Nile, Northern, Aj Jazirah, River Nile, Khartoum, Sennar, West Darfur, and Gedaref. However, the claim specifies that this data is available in July 2025. The provided data does not specify a date, and therefore it cannot be confirmed if it pertains to July 2025. Without this date information, the claim cannot be fully verified.
**Source:** N/A or ACLED CAST

### Claim 2: MIXED
> Hotspots indicate an expected increase of at least 25% in violent events in the short term.

**Justification:** The claim states that hotspots indicate an expected increase of at least 25% in violent events in the short term. The provided data shows that several hotspots have an expected increase of at least 25% in violent events in the short term (Central Darfur: 40%, Blue Nile: 400%, Northern: 28.57%, Aj Jazirah: 71.43%, River Nile: 200%, Khartoum: 48.48%, Sennar: 100%, West Darfur: 100%, Gedaref: 30%). However, the definition of a 'hotspot' and the minimum percentage increase required to classify a region as a hotspot are not provided, making it impossible to definitively confirm the claim for all cases or to understand the criteria used to label these regions as hotspots. Therefore, the claim is partially supported but not fully verifiable with the given information.
