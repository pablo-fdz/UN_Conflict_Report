# Sudan Security Report: A Year in Review and Outlook

## Overview

Sudan has experienced a year of intense conflict, primarily characterized by the ongoing civil war between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This period has seen a significant escalation of hostilities, impacting critical infrastructure, civilian populations, and humanitarian efforts across the country.

## Key Security Events

### Intensified Conflict and Targeting of Infrastructure

The conflict has been marked by a series of drone strikes and ground assaults, particularly targeting strategic locations and civilian facilities:

*   **Port Sudan**: The city has been a focal point of RSF paramilitary drone strikes, marking the first such attacks in the country's two-year civil war. These strikes have targeted civilian facilities, including an air base and a cargo warehouse, and have been followed by large fires at multiple oil depots. Sudanese media have reported new drone attacks with active air defense responses.

*   **Nahud**: Reports indicate ongoing confrontations, with the Sudanese army maintaining defenses against RSF attacks in the city of Nahud, despite social media footage purportedly showing RSF militia in front of local administration headquarters.
    *   *Sources*: Editor's note (Al Arabiya, Al Jazeera reports on Nahud).
*   **Khartoum State & Omdurman**: The battle for control of Khartoum State has continued, with the Sudanese army reporting gains and recapturing areas like Al-Khawi. RSF drone strikes have also targeted power stations in Omdurman.

*   **Other Areas**:
    *   **En Nahud**: RSF forces have been involved in the capture of a prison in En Nahud, leading to inmate release, and have been implicated in looting, attacking public buildings, and killing civilians in the area.

### Humanitarian and Social Impact

The conflict has severely impacted the civilian population and essential services:

*   **Health Crisis**: A cholera outbreak has been reported, with 727 cases and 12 deaths, particularly in Khartoum and North Kordofan. The WHO has facilitated the arrival of 2.9 million doses of oral vaccine against cholera in Port Sudan. Hospitals, such as MSF's hospital in Old Fangak, have been bombed and forced to close.

*   **Infrastructure Damage**: Widespread power cuts have affected cities like Port Sudan, Khartoum, and Wadi Halfa, attributed to damage to energy infrastructure.
    *   *Sources*: Sudanese electric utility company (total power outage, damage to energy infrastructure); Sudanese government (total power outage).
*   **Displacement and Aid**: There have been assessments of refugee conditions and reports of attacks on aid convoys involving UNICEF and WFP.

### External Relations and Political Developments

*   **Government Changes**: A sweeping reshuffle of key state government positions has occurred in Warrap, Central Equatoria, and Upper Nile. There was also a Government Dissolution and Oath Taking by Kamil Idriss and secretaries of ministries.

## Forward-Looking Perspective

Based on the events of the past year, the security situation in Sudan is likely to remain volatile. The continued use of drone strikes and targeting of critical infrastructure by the RSF suggests an ongoing strategy to disrupt government control and exert pressure. The Sudanese army's efforts to regain control in various areas indicate a protracted conflict.

The severe humanitarian impact, including health crises and infrastructure damage, is expected to persist, necessitating continued international aid and attention. The allegations of external support for the RSF and the imposition of international sanctions could further complicate the conflict dynamics and international relations. Without a significant shift in the conflict's trajectory or a political resolution, Sudan is poised for continued instability and humanitarian challenges.
