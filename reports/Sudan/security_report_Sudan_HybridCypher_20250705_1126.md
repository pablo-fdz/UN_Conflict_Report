# Sudan Security Report: Recent Developments and Forward Outlook

## 1. Overview
The security landscape in Sudan remains highly volatile, marked by persistent conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), alongside other armed groups. This ongoing civil war has resulted in widespread violence, significant displacement, and severe humanitarian challenges across the country. Recent events highlight a continuation of intense clashes, particularly in the Darfur region and around strategic urban centers, with the RSF increasingly employing drone warfare. Concurrently, political realignments are emerging, as the RSF seeks to consolidate its control over territories through new alliances.

## 2. Key Security Events

### 2.1 Intensified Clashes and Drone Warfare
The conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has seen continued escalation, characterized by the prominent use of drone technology and ground engagements across multiple states.

-   **North Darfur:** El Fasher and its surrounding areas, including Zamzam Camp and Abu Shouk camp, have been sites of persistent and severe fighting [4, 6, 7, 8]. Clashes between RSF paramilitary and government forces have been reported, leading to large-scale displacement [4, 14]. Shelling by RSF militia forces has targeted civilian areas and displacement camps, resulting in casualties, including at least 14 people killed in one attack and six near a mosque [8, 13, 16]. A local journalist reported new RSF strikes in El Fasher, prompting army artillery responses, with at least 20 people killed in earlier RSF paramilitary shelling [10]. The rebel group Sudan Liberation Movement has called for army assistance in El Fasher due to ongoing paramilitary bombing [9]. The RSF has claimed control over Zamzam camp [14].

-   **River Nile State:** A drone attack was reported on Atbara [1].

-   **White Nile State:** The RSF launched drone strikes on Sudanese military positions in the Arshkool area [3] and targeted the army command in Kosti with drone strikes [12]. Explosions near oil depots in Kosti were also reported [18].

-   **Red Sea State:** Large fires at multiple oil depots in Port Sudan followed a series of RSF paramilitary drone strikes, marking the first such attacks in the city during the civil war [20].

-   **Khartoum State:** Military sources indicated that the army had recaptured Khartoum State in full from the RSF militia, though fighting persisted in Omdurman [11].

-   **Northern State:** Protesters in Wadi Halfa have renewed roadblocking, threatening to escalate actions, including disrupting mining operations [15]. The Sudanese army also reported evacuating border areas with Libya and Egypt to repel an alleged Haftar-supported rebel attack [19].

-   **Al Jazirah State:** The Bank of Khartoum reopened its branch in Hasahisa, Al Jazirah state, after months of suspension due to the security situation, indicating a localized improvement in stability [5].

### 2.2 Political Developments
The RSF has engaged in political maneuvering, forming an alliance with the Sudan Peopleâ€™s Liberation Movement-North and other groups. This alliance aims to govern areas under RSF control, primarily in Darfur [2].

### 2.3 Impact on United Nations Humanitarian Operations
The ongoing conflict has severely impacted humanitarian efforts and civilian populations, exacerbating an already dire situation.

-   **Aid Convoy Attack:** A WFP and UNICEF aid convoy near Al Koma, North Darfur, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of five members and injuries to several others, with multiple trucks burned [17].

-   **Restricted Humanitarian Access:** Humanitarian operations in El Fasher remain "dangerously restricted" [Context].

-   **Civilian Casualties and Displacement:** The conflict has led to malnutrition deaths in El Fasher and continued fighting near displacement camps, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis [Context].

## 3. Forward Outlook

### Armed Conflict Probability Forecast (Conflict Forecast)

According to [ConflictForecast](https://conflictforecast.org/), the predicted probability of armed conflict in Sudan in the next 3 months is of 99.61%.

*This prediction represents the risk that a country suffers an outbreak of armed conflict within the next three months, i.e. that the country goes from no fatalities to over 0.5 fatalities per one million inhabitants within a time horizon of three months.*

The following chart displays the armed conflict risk trend since 2020 until the present day:

### Subnational Perspective
Based on data available in July 2025, nine subnational ADM1 regions are classified as hotspots, indicating an expected increase of at least 25% in violent events in the short term.

#### Predicted Increase in Violent Events in the Short Term (ACLED)

[ACLED CAST](https://acleddata.com/conflict-alert-system/) predicts 9 ADM1 regions in Sudan to be hotspots for violent events in the next calendar month (August, 2025).

*An ADM1 region is considered to be a hotspot if the predicted increase in the number of violent events in the next month compared to the 3-month average is at least of 25%.*

The chart below shows regions with a predicted change in violent events.
