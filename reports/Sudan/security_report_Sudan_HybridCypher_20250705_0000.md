# Sudan Security Report: Recent Developments and Forward Outlook

## 1. Overview
The security landscape in Sudan remains highly volatile, marked by persistent conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), alongside other armed groups. 

## 2. Key Security Events

### 2.1 Intensified Clashes and Drone Warfare
-   **North Darfur:** El Fasher and its surrounding areas, including Zamzam Camp and Abu Shouk camp, have been sites of persistent and severe fighting [4, 6, 7, 8]. 


### 2.2 Political Developments
The RSF has engaged in political maneuvering, forming an alliance with the Sudan Peopleâ€™s Liberation Movement-North and other groups. This alliance aims to govern areas under RSF control, primarily in Darfur [2].

### 2.3 Impact on United Nations Humanitarian Operations
The ongoing conflict has severely impacted humanitarian efforts and civilian populations, exacerbating an already dire situation.

-   **Aid Convoy Attack:** A WFP and UNICEF aid convoy near Al Koma, North Darfur, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of five members and injuries to several others, with multiple trucks burned [17].

## 3. Forward Outlook

### Armed Conflict Probability Forecast (Conflict Forecast)

According to [ConflictForecast](https://conflictforecast.org/), the predicted probability of armed conflict in Sudan in the next 3 months is of 99.61%.

*This prediction represents the risk that a country suffers an outbreak of armed conflict within the next three months, i.e. that the country goes from no fatalities to over 0.5 fatalities per one million inhabitants within a time horizon of three months.*

The following chart displays the armed conflict risk trend since 2020 until the present day:

### Subnational Perspective
Based on data available in July 2025, nine subnational ADM1 regions are classified as hotspots, indicating an expected increase of at least 25% in violent events in the short term.

#### Predicted Increase in Violent Events in the Short Term (ACLED)

[ACLED CAST](https://acleddata.com/conflict-alert-system/) predicts 9 ADM1 regions in Sudan to be hotspots for violent events in the next calendar month (August, 2025).

*An ADM1 region is considered to be a hotspot if the predicted increase in the number of violent events in the next month compared to the 3-month average is at least of 25%.*

The chart below shows regions with a predicted change in violent events.
