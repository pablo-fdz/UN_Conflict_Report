## Security Report: Sudan (Last Year)

**Introduction:**
The past year in Sudan has been defined by an escalating civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), leading to widespread insecurity, humanitarian crises, and significant political instability. Events over the last year highlight a deepening conflict with severe consequences for civilians and critical infrastructure.

**Key Events (Last Year):**

*   **Escalation of Conflict & Civilian Impact:**
    *   **Widespread Drone Attacks:** The RSF significantly expanded its operational reach, employing drone attacks against strategic and civilian targets. Port Sudan, the temporary seat of government, experienced multiple drone strikes targeting its international airport, leading to flight suspensions [https://x.com/ajmurgent/status/1919600139557339410], oil depots [https://x.com/Abdul_RahmanBI/status/1919274843054194895], a naval base, and power stations, causing widespread outages [https://t.me/ajMubasher/357757]. Other areas like Merowe, Atbara, and Kassala also faced drone threats [https://www.sudanakhbar.com/1649132#google_vignette, https://x.com/alrakoba1/status/1921381323614154780, https://www.sudanakhbar.com/1645092].
    *   **Civilian Casualties and Infrastructure Damage:** Civilian populations bore the brunt of the violence. A suspected RSF strike on a prison in El Obeid, North Kurdufan, resulted in at least 21 deaths and 47 injuries [https://x.com/SDN154/status/1921160409974743523]. An attack on a hospital in El Obeid killed at least six civilians and injured 14, leading to the hospital's closure [https://x.com/SDN154/status/1928388460236190114]. Drone strikes near a market in al-Koma caused 89 casualties (killed and injured) [https://www.darfur24.com/2025/06/01/%d8%ba%d8%b1%d9%81%d8%a9-%d8%b7%d9%88%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%a6-%d9%85%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%88%d8%a5%d8%b5%d8%a7%d8%a8%d8%a9-89-%d8%b4%d8%ae%d8%b5%d9%8b%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%b5%d9%81-%d8%b9%d9%84/]. Fighting in El Fasher and Abu Shouk Camp in North Darfur led to at least 19 deaths [https://x.com/SDN154/status/1924093320348774779]. The RSF also reportedly captured the town of En Nahud in South Kordofan [https://x.com/SudansPost/status/1917905691345404168].
    *   **Attacks on Humanitarian Aid:** A critical incident involved an attack on a WFP and UNICEF aid convoy near Al Koma, resulting in five deaths and the burning of multiple trucks carrying life-saving supplies [https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/wfpunicef-humanitarian-aid-convoy-carrying-life-saving-supplies-attacked-sudans].

*   **Humanitarian and Governance Challenges:**
    *   **Health Crisis:** Beyond the conflict, Sudan faced a cholera outbreak, with 12 deaths and 727 cases identified across the country as of May 31 [https://t.me/ajMubasher/369325].
    *   **Government Instability:** The transitional Prime Minister Kamil Idriss dissolved the government, tasking ministry secretaries with responsibilities until a new government is formed, signaling continued political flux [https://x.com/SudanTribune_EN/status/1929258985674174765].
    *   **Regional Economic Impact:** The Sudanese government drafted contingency plans to suspend the export of South Sudanese oil via Port Sudan if RSF strikes further destabilize the oil transit system, highlighting the conflict's potential regional economic ramifications [https://www.radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/sudan-prepares-to-halt-south-sudan-oil-experts].
    *   **Refugee Concerns:** Syria announced plans to send representatives to assess conditions for Syrian refugees in Sudan and facilitate evacuations [https://x.com/AsaadHShaibani/status/1921688211694244066].

**Forward-Looking Perspective:**

The immediate future of Sudan remains highly volatile and concerning. The RSF's demonstrated capability to conduct widespread drone attacks, even reaching the government's temporary capital, suggests a prolonged and destructive conflict. The ongoing civil war is likely to continue driving massive internal displacement and refugee flows, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation.

The dissolution of the transitional government underscores deep-seated political instability, which will likely hinder any unified national response to the crisis or progress towards a lasting peace. The continued targeting of critical infrastructure and humanitarian aid efforts will further cripple the economy and deepen the humanitarian crisis, leading to increased food insecurity and the spread of diseases.

Without a significant shift towards a negotiated political settlement and robust international support for humanitarian access and civilian protection, Sudan faces a high risk of further fragmentation, widespread suffering, and potential regional destabilization. The protection of civilians, unhindered humanitarian access, and a credible, inclusive political process are paramount to altering Sudan's current trajectory.
