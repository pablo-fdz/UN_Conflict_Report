## Sudan Security Report: A Year of Escalation and Humanitarian Crisis

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on "last year" context from provided data)

**Introduction:**
The past year has seen Sudan plunged into a devastating civil war, primarily between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This conflict has profoundly reshaped the country's security landscape, leading to widespread destruction, a severe humanitarian crisis, and significant instability. Events over the last year highlight a brutal struggle for control, marked by strategic targeting of infrastructure and immense civilian suffering.

**Key Events in the Last Year:**

*   **Intensified Conflict and Strategic Targeting:**
    *   The conflict escalated dramatically, with the **RSF extensively employing drone attacks** against critical infrastructure and military targets.
    *   **Port Sudan**, a vital Red Sea port, became a frequent target. RSF drones attacked **civilian facilities**, including the **Osman Digna Air Base**, a **cargo warehouse**, **multiple oil depots**, **fuel depots**, and the **Port Sudan International Airport**. These attacks resulted in **large fires**, **power outages**, and **flights suspended** (Source: Sudanese military, local media, Al Jazeera, eyewitnesses).
    *   Other key infrastructure was also hit: The **Atbara airport** (a government-controlled airport) and **military bases** in Kosti and Port Sudan faced repeated drone strikes, leading to **air traffic disruptions** (Source: Sudanese military, local media).
    *   **Power stations** in Omdurman and Port Sudan were targeted by long-range RSF drone strikes, causing **damage to energy infrastructure** and **power outages** in Khartoum (Source: Sudanese energy ministry, Sudanese electric utility company).
    *   The **University of Khartoum in Omdurman** was also specifically targeted with explosive drones by the RSF (Source: Al Jazeera).

*   **Humanitarian Catastrophe and Civilian Impact:**
    *   Civilians bore the brunt of the violence. RSF forces were reported to have **attacked civilians**, resulting in **killed and injured**, and engaged in widespread **looting** and **attacking public buildings** (Source: Provided intelligence records).
    *   **Hospitals** were not spared, with reports of RSF attacks on facilities like the **Social Security Hospital in El Fasher** and a **hospital in Old Fangak**, leading to closures and hindering medical aid (Source: Provided intelligence records, MSF).
    *   **Prisons** were also targeted, with RSF forces conducting **strikes on prisons** in En Nahud and El Fasher, leading to **inmate releases** and **prison captures** (Source: Sudan Doctors Union, provided intelligence records).
    *   An **attack on an aid convoy** involving UNICEF and WFP was reported in El Fasher and Al Koma, severely hindering humanitarian efforts (Source: UNICEF, WFP).
    *   A significant **cholera outbreak** was reported, with 727 cases and 12 deaths, particularly affecting Khartoum and Northern State (Source: health ministry, officials).
    *   The discovery of **465 bodies in mass graves** in the Shagra area highlighted the scale of atrocities against civilians (Source: Sudanese armed forces).

*   **Territorial Control and Military Maneuvers:**
    *   The RSF initially captured **En Nahud** and other areas, but the SAF launched **large-scale operations** to regain control.
    *   The SAF reported **recapturing Khartoum State**, the **Al-Dabaibat area**, and the **Shagra area** in Omdurman, indicating some military gains against the RSF (Source: Sudanese armed forces, military source, Al Jazeera).
    *   Both sides engaged in **airstrikes** and **military shelling** across various regions, including Nyala, El Fasher, and Old Fangak (Source: Sudanese armed forces, local media).

*   **External Dimensions:**
    *   Sudan accused the **UAE of violating international conventions**, implying external support for the RSF (Source: Sudan).
    *   The **US imposed sanctions on Sudan** in response to the ongoing conflict (Source: US).

**Forward-Looking Perspective:**

The security situation in Sudan remains highly volatile and deeply concerning. The past year's events underscore a protracted conflict with severe consequences for the civilian population and national infrastructure.

*   **Continued Conflict and Instability:** The entrenched positions of the SAF and RSF suggest that the civil war is likely to persist, leading to further violence, displacement, and humanitarian needs. The RSF's continued use of drone technology indicates a persistent threat to strategic locations, including those previously considered safer.
*   **Deepening Humanitarian Crisis:** Without a comprehensive cessation of hostilities and guaranteed humanitarian access, the humanitarian crisis, including widespread food insecurity, escalating disease outbreaks (like cholera), and mass displacement, will worsen. The continued destruction of critical infrastructure, particularly energy and health facilities, will exacerbate civilian suffering and hinder any recovery efforts.
*   **Economic Collapse:** The systematic targeting of oil depots, ports, and other economic infrastructure will continue to cripple Sudan's economy, hindering any prospects for recovery and development. The disruption of vital trade routes and the suspension of South Sudanese oil exports through Port Sudan further complicate the economic outlook, potentially leading to a complete collapse.
*   **Regional Implications:** The conflict carries a significant risk of regional destabilization, with potential spillover effects on neighboring countries due to massive refugee flows, cross-border illicit activities, and the potential for proxy conflicts.
*   **Path Forward:** A sustainable resolution hinges on a credible and inclusive political process that addresses the root causes of the conflict and includes all Sudanese stakeholders. International pressure, including targeted sanctions and robust diplomatic engagement, will be crucial to push for a durable ceasefire, ensure the protection of civilians, and facilitate unimpeded humanitarian aid. Rebuilding trust, institutions, and the shattered infrastructure will be a monumental task, requiring long-term, coordinated international support.
