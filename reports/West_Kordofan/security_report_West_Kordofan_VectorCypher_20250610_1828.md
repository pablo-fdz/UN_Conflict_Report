## Security Report: West Kordofan (Last Year)

### Introduction

This report provides a brief overview of the security situation in West Kordofan over the past year, focusing on key events and their implications. The region, like much of Sudan, has been significantly impacted by the ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). While some reports in the provided context place the town of Nahud in South or North Kordofan, local media and military denials specifically linked it to West Kordofan, making it the primary focus of security concerns in the area for this report.

### Key Events (Last Year)

The security landscape in West Kordofan was dominated by the intense and contested struggle for control over the town of Nahud.

*   **Contested Control of Nahud:**
    *   **RSF Attack and Reported Seizure:** Local media reported significant clashes in Nahud, with video footage showing residents fleeing the city. These reports indicated that RSF paramilitary forces had reportedly seized control of the city [1]. Sudanese media also reported the capture of En Nahud by rebel RSF following a sustained attack on army forces [2]. The Rapid Support Forces were reported to have attacked the city of Nahud, as cited by Al Jazeera from a military source [3].
    *   **Sudanese Military Denial and Resistance:** The Sudanese military swiftly denied reports of losing control of West Kordofan's Nahud town [1]. Al Arabiya, citing a Sudanese army source, stated that defenses remained in place in Nahud, in response to social media footage purportedly showing RSF militia in front of local administration headquarters [4]. Al Jazeera also reported that a military garrison in Nahud was holding out against the RSF attack [4].

*   **Civilian and Infrastructure Impact:**
    *   The conflict in Nahud (also referred to as En Nahud in some reports) led to severe consequences for civilians and infrastructure. The RSF was implicated in acts of looting, attacking public buildings, and killing civilians [5].
    *   Furthermore, the prison in En Nahud was reportedly captured by the RSF, leading to the release of inmates [5].

### Forward-Looking Perspective on the Future of the Country

The events in West Kordofan, particularly the contested control of Nahud, are indicative of the broader, volatile security landscape across Sudan. The rapid shifts in territorial claims and the persistent clashes between the SAF and RSF suggest a prolonged conflict with no immediate end in sight.

The humanitarian impact observed in Nahud—including civilian displacement, looting, and attacks on public infrastructure—is a microcosm of the deepening crisis affecting the entire country. This pattern of conflict exacerbates the suffering of the Sudanese population, disrupts essential services, and hinders any prospects for recovery and development.

For the future of Sudan, a sustainable resolution is critically dependent on an immediate and comprehensive cessation of hostilities. Without a credible political process that addresses the root causes of the conflict and ensures the protection of civilians, regions like West Kordofan will likely continue to experience severe instability. This ongoing turmoil threatens to fragment the country further, deepen humanitarian needs, and undermine any efforts towards peace and stability. The path forward requires concerted international and regional efforts to pressure the warring parties towards dialogue and a civilian-led transitional government.
