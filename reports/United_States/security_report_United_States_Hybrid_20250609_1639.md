### **I. Key Security Events (Last Year)**

The past year has seen the United States grapple with a multifaceted security environment, characterized by evolving domestic and international challenges.

*   **Persistent Domestic Extremism and Political Violence:**
    *   **Event Focus:** Continued threats and isolated incidents from domestic violent extremist (DVE) groups, particularly those motivated by racial or ethnically motivated violent extremism (RMVE) and anti-government/anti-authority ideologies. Law enforcement agencies reported a sustained high volume of threats against public officials, electoral processes, and critical infrastructure. While no single large-scale attack dominated headlines, the cumulative effect of numerous smaller-scale plots and acts of intimidation underscored a volatile domestic landscape.
    *   **Impact:** Erosion of public trust, increased strain on law enforcement resources, and heightened political polarization.
*   **Escalating Cyberattacks and Ransomware:**
    *   **Event Focus:** The nation experienced a continuous barrage of cyberattacks, with ransomware remaining a primary concern. Significant incidents targeted various sectors, including healthcare, education, and local government entities, disrupting services and leading to substantial financial losses. State-sponsored actors from nations like Russia and China continued sophisticated espionage and intellectual property theft campaigns, alongside probing critical infrastructure networks.
    *   **Impact:** Economic disruption, compromise of sensitive data, and a persistent threat to national security and economic competitiveness.
*   **Border Security and Migration Challenges:**
    *   **Event Focus:** The U.S. southern border continued to face unprecedented levels of migrant encounters, posing significant humanitarian, logistical, and security challenges. While not a direct "attack," the sheer volume strained resources, and concerns persisted regarding drug trafficking (particularly fentanyl) and potential exploitation by criminal organizations.
    *   **Impact:** Overwhelmed border agencies, humanitarian crises, and ongoing political debate regarding immigration policy.
*   **Geopolitical Tensions and Foreign Influence Operations:**
    *   **Event Focus:** The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and heightened tensions with China (e.g., over Taiwan, economic competition, and surveillance activities) continued to shape U.S. foreign policy and domestic security. Foreign adversaries engaged in sophisticated disinformation campaigns aimed at sowing discord, influencing public opinion, and undermining democratic processes within the U.S.
    *   **Impact:** Increased risk of international escalation, challenges to democratic integrity, and a complex global security environment.

### **II. Forward-Looking Perspective**

The security landscape for the United States is expected to remain complex and dynamic, with several key trends shaping future challenges:

*   **Domestic Extremism Evolution:** Domestic violent extremism will likely persist, potentially evolving in tactics and targets. The proliferation of online radicalization and the ease of access to extremist ideologies will continue to pose a significant challenge. The lead-up to the 2024 election cycle could exacerbate existing tensions and increase the risk of politically motivated violence.
*   **Advanced Cyber Warfare:** Cyber threats will become more sophisticated, with an increasing focus on critical infrastructure, supply chains, and the exploitation of emerging technologies (e.g., AI, quantum computing). State-sponsored actors will continue to refine their capabilities for espionage, disruption, and potential pre-positioning for future conflict.
*   **Great Power Competition:** Competition with China and Russia will intensify across all domains â€“ economic, technological, military, and informational. This will necessitate continued investment in defense, intelligence, and diplomatic capabilities, while also managing the risk of miscalculation or escalation.
*   **Climate Change as a Security Multiplier:** The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (e.g., wildfires, floods, droughts) will place greater strain on national resources, infrastructure, and emergency response systems. These events can also exacerbate existing social vulnerabilities and potentially contribute to migration flows.
*   **Technological Disruption:** Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and autonomous systems will present both opportunities and significant security risks. The dual-use nature of these technologies requires proactive policy development to mitigate misuse by adversaries while harnessing their benefits for national security.

**Conclusion:**
The United States faces a complex array of security challenges, ranging from persistent domestic threats to an increasingly volatile international environment. A comprehensive approach involving robust intelligence gathering, proactive cybersecurity defenses, strategic international partnerships, and resilient domestic infrastructure will be crucial for safeguarding national security in the coming year and beyond.
