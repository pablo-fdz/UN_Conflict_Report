Based on the provided context, the information pertains exclusively to the security situation in **Sudan**, detailing events such as drone attacks, military conflicts between the Sudanese army and RSF forces, sanctions, and humanitarian crises.

There is **no information available in the provided context regarding the United States' security situation** in the last year, nor any events related to the U.S. that could form the basis of such a report.

Therefore, I am unable to generate a security report for the United States as requested, as the provided data does not contain any relevant events or details about the U.S.
