   'comment': "The claims about territorial control (SAF recapturing Khartoum in March, RSF's capture of Mellit, SAF's advances in Omdurman) need to be verified against known data. If these claims are not precise, they need to be corrected. If they are accurate, the source of this information should be cited."},
  'accuracy_3': {'score': 4,
   'comment': 'While no data points are explicitly missing or misstated, the report should include casualty figures or other relevant data to support the claim about the drop in violence. This would improve the accuracy and impact of the report.'},

  'clarity_1': {'score': 4,
   'comment': 'The progression of ideas is generally logical, but the connection between the drop in violence and the SAF recapturing Khartoum could be made more explicit. A sentence explaining this relationship would improve clarity.'},
  'clarity_2': {'score': 5, 'comment': 'Excellent'},
  'analysis_1': {'score': 3,
   'comment': "The report mentions a critical shift in alliances but doesn't elaborate on the underlying drivers or implications of this shift. Providing more context on why the alliances shifted and how this affects the conflict would improve the analysis."},
  'analysis_2': {'score': 4,
   'comment': 'The section portrays existing dynamics, but could be improved by providing more nuanced information. For example, instead of just stating that violence dropped, the report could mention specific areas where the drop was most significant or any factors that might be contributing to the change.'},
  'analysis_3': {'score': 4,
   'comment': 'The paragraph\'s main point is generally clear, but the topic sentence could be more specific. For example, instead of just saying "Political violence across Sudan dropped...", the sentence could mention the specific type of violence or the areas where the drop was most significant.'}},

  'relevance_2': {'score': 4,
   'comment': 'While the points are generally specific, adding quantifiable data (e.g., numbers of fighters, specific locations of clashes) would further enhance specificity and merit a score of 5.'},
  'clarity_1': {'score': 4,
   'comment': 'The progression is generally logical, but a brief introductory sentence outlining the overall theme of shifting alliances in Darfur would improve the flow and earn a score of 5.'},

  'clarity_3': {'score': 4,
   'comment': 'The affiliations are mostly clear, but explicitly stating what SAF and RSF stand for (Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces) at least once in the report would ensure complete clarity for all readers and warrant a score of 5.'},

   'comment': "The progression is generally logical, but could be improved by providing more context or explanation for each point. For example, explaining the significance of the Heglig Oil Field location or the implications of Hilal's alignment with SAF in more detail would enhance clarity."},
  'clarity_2': {'score': 4,
   'comment': "Sentences are mostly concise and coherent, but some could be more specific. For example, 'Displaced populations around El Fasher have been specifically targeted' could benefit from specifying who is targeting them and how."},
  'impartiality_1': {'score': 4,
   'comment': "The language is mostly neutral, but the phrase 'RSF abducted 60 UN peacekeepers' could be perceived as slightly loaded. A more neutral phrasing, such as 'RSF detained 60 UN peacekeepers,' might be preferable, depending on the specific context and intent. Also, 'SAF reportedly killed over 100 RSF supporters' needs to be carefully worded to avoid implying endorsement of the report."},
