    "Summary of Recent Developments" : {
        # ACCURACY
        "accuracy_1": "Does the summary correctly state the timeline and magnitude of evolutions in the violence state?",
        "accuracy_2": "Are all claims about territorial control (e.g., “SAF recapturing Khartoum in March” or “RSF’s capture of Mellit”) factually precise and verifiable against known data?",
        "accuracy_3": "Is any key data point—such as casualty figures or dates of major events—either missing or misstated?",
        # RELEVANCE
        "relevance_1": "Does the summary capture the most critical shifts in the security landscape (e.g., force realignments vs. territorial changes) that a UN humanitarian reader needs to know at a glance?",
        "relevance_2": "Are all major developments (e.g., significant battles, humanitarian consequences, or ceasefire attempts) included such that the “big picture” is complete?",
        "relevance_3": "Does the section avoid including minor details that distract from the core trends (i.e., is it focused on what matters most for operational planning)?",
        # CLARITY AND STRUCTURE
        "clarity_1": "Is the progression of ideas logical so a reader can follow without confusion?",
        "clarity_2": "Are sentences concise and well-punctuated, without jargon or overly complex clauses that could hinder quick comprehension?",
        # ANALYISIS
        "analysis_1": "Does it highlight any underlying drivers of the shifts rather than just stating the events (for instance, if a change in alliances occurs, stating the implications for the conflict rather than just mentioning its occurence)?",
        "analysis_2": "Does the section portray existing dynamics and nuances rather than just static facts? For instance, “violence dropped in respect to previous months” rather than “the number of weekly casualties is X”",
        "analysis_3": "Is each paragraph’s main point clearly signposted (for example, a topic sentence like “Political violence across Sudan dropped…” followed by supporting facts)?",
    },
    
    "Key Alliance Shifts": {
        # RELEVANCE
        "relevance_1": "Does this section portray exclusively occurrences related to the actors and alliances involved in Sudan?",
        "relevance_2": "Do all points in this section contain information that is specific (as opposed to mere generalising statements)?",
        # CLARITY AND STRUCTURE
        "clarity_1": "Is the progression of ideas logical so a reader can follow without confusion?",
        "clarity_2": "Are sentences concise, coherent, and well-punctuated?",
        "clarity_3": "Can the reader clearly identify the affiliations of each group from this text?",
        # IMPARTIALITY/NEUTRALITY
        "impartiality_1": "Is the language free of loaded or emotive wording? (e.g., terms like “liberated” vs. “recaptured” should be used consistently and neutrally)",
        "impartiality_2": "Are all actors described by their proper names and affiliations without value judgments (e.g., simply stating the name of actors rather than terms such as “terrorists”)?",
    },

    "Security Implications for UN Operations": {
        # RELEVANCE
        "relevance_1": "Do all points in this section contain information that is relevant to the work and operation of humanitarian workers?",
        # CLARITY AND STRUCTURE
        "clarity_1": "Is the progression of ideas logical so a reader can follow without confusion?",
