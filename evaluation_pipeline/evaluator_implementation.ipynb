This decline is correlated with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) regaining control of key areas in Khartoum in March 2025, which resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in violent incidents within Khartoum state compared to February [Source: UN OCHA Situation Report, March 2025]. While overall casualty figures remain high, the decrease in reported incidents suggests a localized improvement in security.\\n\\nBeyond territorial gains, primarily SAF advances in Omdurman and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) capture of Mellit [Source: Crisis Group Sudan Conflict Update, May 2025], the Sudanese security landscape is characterized by a significant realignment of forces, particularly impacting Darfur. This shift in alliances, driven by factors including resource competition and ethnic tensions, has complicated humanitarian access in previously accessible areas and altered operational parameters for aid organizations. While ceasefire attempts have been made, they have largely been unsuccessful in creating sustained humanitarian corridors. The implications of these realignments require close monitoring to adapt aid delivery strategies and ensure continued assistance to vulnerable populations.\",\n",
