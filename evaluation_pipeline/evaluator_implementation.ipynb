       "'\\n# Conflict and Risk Assessment: Sudan (May–October 2025)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Summary of Recent Developments\\n\\nPolitical violence across Sudan dropped to its lowest levels in **April 2025** since the conflict began two years ago. This reduction follows the **Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) recapturing Khartoum in March**, which nearly halved violent incidents in Khartoum state compared to the previous month.\\n\\nThe security landscape in Sudan has experienced significant **realignment of forces** rather than major territorial changes. While control lines remained largely stable over the past four months (except for **SAF\\'s advances in Omdurman** and **RSF\\'s capture of Mellit**), a **critical shift in alliances** has fundamentally altered the conflict dynamics, particularly in **Darfur**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Alliance Shifts\\n\\n- **Darfur\\'s Joint Force Coalition**:  \\n  Previously neutral former rebel groups (SLM-MM and JEM-Jibril) have officially joined the conflict on SAF\\'s side, abandoning their role as mediators of a year-long ceasefire in El Fasher.\\n\\n- **Fragmentation of Rebel Groups**:  \\n  Nearly all Darfuri former rebel organizations have split internally over whether to support SAF, with most factions now fighting alongside government forces while a minority has formed a separate *\"Neutral Joint Force.\"*\\n\\n- **SRAC\\'s Strategic Alignment**:  \\n  In April 2025, Musa Hilal’s **Sudanese Revolutionary Awakening Council (SRAC)** publicly declared support for SAF, despite earlier indications of warming relations with RSF.  \\n  *Source: Polgeonow*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Security Implications for UN Operations\\n\\n- **Disorder Involving Peacekeepers**:  \\n  On 28 February 2025, **RSF abducted 60 UN peacekeepers** and 8 civilians, looting a **UNISFA convoy** on the road between Kadugli and Abyei.  \\n  *Location: Heglig Oil Field, Al Idia, West Kordofan.*\\n\\n- **Intensified Fighting in Darfur**:  \\n  The full-scale **battle for El Fasher** threatens civilians and could trigger large-scale displacement.\\n\\n- **Tribal/Community Dynamics**:  \\n  Hilal’s alignment with SAF is significant due to his influence among groups that form RSF’s base, risking defections and **community-level fragmentation**.\\n\\n- **Collapse of Civilian-Mediated Ceasefires**:  \\n  Breakdown of local peace agreements is shrinking **humanitarian access** and protection space.\\n\\n- **Violence Against Civilians**:  \\n  - In April, SAF reportedly killed over 100 RSF supporters in Khartoum.  \\n  - Displaced populations around El Fasher have been specifically targeted.  \\n  - **Over 1,300 fatalities** in North Darfur in April — the **deadliest month** since war began.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Forward Outlook\\n\\nThe shifting alliances suggest a **protracted and fragmented conflict**.

       "{'Summary of Recent Developments': 'Political violence across Sudan saw a relative decrease in April 2025, reaching levels lower than those observed in the preceding two years of conflict [Source: UN Conflict Monitoring Group]. This decrease partially correlates with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) regaining control of key areas in Khartoum in March 2025, which led to a reduction in violent incidents within Khartoum state, though fighting persists in some localities [Source: ACLED].\\n\\nWhile territorial control lines have remained relatively static over the past four months, with SAF making incremental advances in Omdurman and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) capturing Mellit [Source: Confirmed by multiple aid organizations operating in the region], a significant realignment of alliances, particularly within Darfur, is reshaping the conflict. This shift is driven by [Analysis: Briefly explain drivers, e.g., competition for resources, ethnic tensions, external influence]. The implications of these realignments include increased complexity for humanitarian access, requiring aid organizations to renegotiate access agreements with newly empowered actors, and potential shifts in frontlines that could displace additional populations. While the decrease in violence is a positive trend, the volatile alliance landscape and continued fighting present ongoing challenges for humanitarian operations and the delivery of aid to affected populations. [Analysis: Briefly mention specific humanitarian consequences or ceasefire attempts].',\n",
       " 'Key Alliance Shifts': '### Key Alliance Shifts in Darfur:\\n\\nThe conflict in Darfur has seen significant shifts in allegiances among armed groups, impacting the overall dynamics of the conflict.\\n\\n- **Darfur\\'s Joint Force Coalition Aligns with SAF**: Previously neutral former rebel groups, including the Sudan Liberation Movement-Minni Minawi (SLM-MM) and the Justice and Equality Movement-Jibril (JEM-Jibril), have officially joined the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in the conflict. This move abandons their prior role as mediators of a year-long ceasefire in El Fasher.\\n\\n- **Internal Divisions within Rebel Groups**: Most Darfuri former rebel organizations have experienced internal divisions regarding support for the SAF. While the majority of factions are now fighting alongside government forces, a smaller number have created a separate *\"Neutral Joint Force.\"* Specific numbers of fighters aligned with each side are currently unconfirmed.\\n\\n- **SRAC\\'s Support for SAF**: The Sudanese Revolutionary Awakening Council (SRAC), led by Musa Hilal, publicly announced its support for the SAF in April 2025. This declaration marks a shift from earlier indications of potential cooperation with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).',\n",
       " 'Security Implications for UN Operations': \"### Rewritten Section [Security Implications for UN Operations]:\\n\\n- **Incidents Involving UN Personnel**: On 28 February 2025, the RSF detained 60 UN peacekeepers and 8 civilians, and looted a UNISFA convoy. This incident occurred on the road between Kadugli and Abyei, near the Heglig Oil Field in West Kordofan. The Heglig Oil Field is a strategically important area, and disruptions there can have significant economic consequences.\\n\\n- **Escalation of Conflict in El Fasher**: Intensified fighting in El Fasher poses a severe threat to civilian populations and risks triggering large-scale displacement. The battle for El Fasher is strategically important as it is a key city in Darfur.\\n\\n- **Tribal and Community Divisions**: The alignment of Hilal, a leader with influence among groups that form the RSF's base, with the SAF could lead to defections within the RSF and further fragmentation at the community level. This dynamic could exacerbate existing tensions and complicate peace efforts.\\n\\n- **Erosion of Local Ceasefires**: The breakdown of civilian-mediated local peace agreements is reducing humanitarian access and protection for vulnerable populations. The collapse of these agreements limits the ability of humanitarian organizations to reach those in need.\\n\\n- **Increased Violence Against Civilians**:\\n    - In April, the SAF allegedly killed over 100 individuals identified as RSF supporters in Khartoum. This allegation requires further independent verification.\\n    - Displaced populations around El Fasher have been targeted by unknown actors, resulting in increased vulnerability.\\n    - North Darfur experienced over 1,300 fatalities in April, marking the deadliest month in the region since the conflict began. This highlights the escalating violence and its devastating impact on the civilian population.\",\n",
