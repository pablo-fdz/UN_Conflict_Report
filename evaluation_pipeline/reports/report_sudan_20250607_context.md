Editor's note: Local media is reporting that the Sudanese government has drafted contingency plans to suspend the import and export of oil from South Sudan in the event of further RSF strikes to destabilize the oil transit system. Recent drone strikes have impacted pump stations, depots and port facilities on the Red Sea. Radio Tamazuj is reporting that a letter, dated Friday, showed the Sudanese government warning South Sudan that they would be unable to facilitate the export of South Sudanese oil from Port Sudan if the transportation system was further compromised. They describe the risk as high, and the contingency plans as "fast track." We will keep an eye out for any reports of further disruption along key exchange routes. -Sarah
