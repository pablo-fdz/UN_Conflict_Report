# Conflict and Risk Assessment: Sudan (May–October 2025)

---

## Summary of Recent Developments

Political violence across Sudan dropped to its lowest levels in **April 2025** since the conflict began two years ago. This reduction follows the **Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) recapturing Khartoum in March**, which nearly halved violent incidents in Khartoum state compared to the previous month.

The security landscape in Sudan has experienced significant **realignment of forces** rather than major territorial changes. While control lines remained largely stable over the past four months (except for **SAF's advances in Omdurman** and **RSF's capture of Mellit**), a **critical shift in alliances** has fundamentally altered the conflict dynamics, particularly in **Darfur**.

---

## Key Alliance Shifts

- **Darfur's Joint Force Coalition**:  
  Previously neutral former rebel groups (SLM-MM and JEM-Jibril) have officially joined the conflict on SAF's side, abandoning their role as mediators of a year-long ceasefire in El Fasher.

- **Fragmentation of Rebel Groups**:  
  Nearly all Darfuri former rebel organizations have split internally over whether to support SAF, with most factions now fighting alongside government forces while a minority has formed a separate *"Neutral Joint Force."*

- **SRAC's Strategic Alignment**:  
  In April 2025, Musa Hilal’s **Sudanese Revolutionary Awakening Council (SRAC)** publicly declared support for SAF, despite earlier indications of warming relations with RSF.

## Security Implications for UN Operations

- **Disorder Involving Peacekeepers**:  
  On 28 February 2025, **RSF abducted 60 UN peacekeepers** and 8 civilians, looting a **UNISFA convoy** on the road between Kadugli and Abyei.  
  *Location: Heglig Oil Field, Al Idia, West Kordofan.*

- **Intensified Fighting in Darfur**:  
  The full-scale **battle for El Fasher** threatens civilians and could trigger large-scale displacement.

- **Tribal/Community Dynamics**:  
  Hilal’s alignment with SAF is significant due to his influence among groups that form RSF’s base, risking defections and **community-level fragmentation**.

- **Collapse of Civilian-Mediated Ceasefires**:  
  Breakdown of local peace agreements is shrinking **humanitarian access** and protection space.

- **Violence Against Civilians**:  
  - In April, SAF reportedly killed over 100 RSF supporters in Khartoum.  
  - Displaced populations around El Fasher have been specifically targeted.  
  - **Over 1,300 fatalities** in North Darfur in April — the **deadliest month** since war began.

## Forward Outlook

The shifting alliances suggest a **protracted and fragmented conflict**. UNDP programming should prepare for:

- Elevated humanitarian needs
- Increased risks to civilian protection
- Engagement with **localized and complex power structures**, particularly in Darfur

---

## Key Trends

- Increased targeting of civilians, especially in **West Darfur** *(ACLED Regional Report, May 2025)*
- Disintegration of national command structures → rise of **local warlordism**
- **Regional spillovers** involving armed groups from Chad and South Sudan

---

## Hotspots

### Port Sudan

RSF launched **drone strikes** in May 2025 targeting:

- International airport and Osman Digna Air Base  
- Fuel depots and civilian medical facilities  
- City's power substation → **blackout**

This escalation threatens **aid operations** and SAF’s governance logistics.

### Central Darfur

RSF claims **full control** after clashes in Zalingei. Reports include:

- Use of displaced civilians as **human shields**  
- Attacks on civilian camps  
- Destruction of infrastructure

RSF aims to control all of Darfur, securing **border access and supply lines**.

### Sennar

Intense fighting over:

- **Sennar Sugar Factory** and surrounding villages  
- **Jabal Moya** — a strategic junction between multiple states

RSF’s push to reclaim Sennar reflects its **strategic value**, bordering four states and two countries.

### Abyei

Abyei, a **disputed oil-rich region**, faces growing instability due to:

- February 2025 RSF attack on UN convoy  
- Political limbo → local conflict and neglect  
- Refugee influx and **elite manipulation of borders**

---

## Broader Conflict Context

- In **March 2025**, SAF **recaptured Khartoum**, pushing RSF to escalate elsewhere.
- International actors are reportedly involved — e.g., **UAE allegedly supplying RSF with Chinese-guided bombs**.
- Over **2 million displaced** in Q1 2025 alone, due to violence in Darfur, Khartoum, and other regions.

The RSF appears to be pursuing a **“partition” strategy**, consolidating western control while destabilizing SAF’s eastern strongholds — **as the war enters its third year**.
